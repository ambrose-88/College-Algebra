    <title>The Definition of Complex Numbers</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            When you learned numbers, you started off with the Counting (Natural) Numbers <me>1,2,3,\ldots</me>.
            Then you learned about zero and you had access to <me>0,1,2,3,\ldots</me>.
            Then you learned about negative numbers and expanded your list of numbers to the integers <me>\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots</me>.
            Then you learned about fractions and expanded your knowledge of numbers to the rational numbers <me>\ldots,-1,\ldots,0,\ldots,1,\ldots,\frac{1}{4},\ldots,\frac{1}{3},\ldots,\frac{1}{2},\ldots,1,\ldots</me>.
            Finally, you learned about radicals and numbers to expand your knowledge of numbers to the real number system.
            But your journey is not yet complete.
            There is one more layer to numbers you will learn in this section: complex numbers.

        <title>The Imaginary Number <m>i</m></title>
        <p>
            If we try to solve the equation <m>x^2+1=0</m> for <m>x</m>, the square root method gives us <m>x=\pm \sqrt{-1}</m>.
            But, since we are not allowed to take the square root of negative numbers in the real number system, we simply say there is no solution.
            But when we say this, we mean there is no real solution; in other words, there is no value of <m>x</m> on the real number line that will satisfy this equation.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what do we know in this case?
            Well, since no number we have learned about so far can be a solution to <m>x^2+1=0</m>, it has to be some other number we have not considered before.
            Let us call it <m>i</m> for imaginary since we just made it up.
            This implies that <m>i=\sqrt{-1}</m>, which implies that <m>i^2=-1</m>.
            This is how we define this number.
        </p>

                <p>
                    The <term>imaginary number</term> <m>i</m> is the positive solution to the equation <me>x^2+1=0</me>.

        <p>
            Powers of <m>i</m> are really easy to calculate, and unlike real numbers, there are only four values you have to memorize since the powers cycle through four unique values.
        </p>

                <mrow>i^0 \amp= 1 \amp i^4 \amp= (i^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1</mrow>

        </p>
        <p>
            The pattern continues forever like this.
            If we look at the first four exponents—<m>0,1,2,3</m>—these are the possible remainders you get when you divide an integer by <m>4</m>.
            Notice that the powers of <m>i</m> that have the same remainder after dividing the exponent by <m>4</m> will have the same value.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, we remind you of the following fact.
        </p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-divisibility-rule-for-4">
            <title>Divisibility Rule for 4</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    An integer is divisible by <m>4</m> if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by <m>4</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>

        <note xml:id="note-divisibility-rule-in-terms-of-remainders">
            <title>Divisibility Rule in Terms of Remainders</title>
            <p>
                In the language above, this means that a number is divisible by <m>4</m> if you divide the last two digits by <m>4</m> and get a remainder of <m>0</m>.
            </p>
        </note>

        <p>
            It turns out that this rule also works for remainders as well.
            Therefore, if we divide the last two digits of a number by <m>4</m> and look at the remainder we get, this tells us which power of <m>i</m> to use.

                <p>
                    Since the remainder is equal to <m>3</m>, we have that <me>i^{487562438573735} = i^3 = -i</me>.

        <p>
            Now that we know about the number <m>i</m>, we are ready to define complex numbers.
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-complex-number">

        <p>
            Do complex numbers really exist?
            The symbol <m>i</m> was given the epithet “imaginary” since some mathematicians debated their existence before complex numbers were firmly established as a legitimate number system.
            It turns out that complex numbers are just another way to describe points <m>(a,b)</m> in the coordinate plane.
            For example, the point <m>(3,4)</m> can also be represented by the complex number <m>3+4i</m>.
            But there is a subtle difference.
            Instead of thinking of it as the corner of a rectangle, we think of <m>3+4i</m> as an arrow pointing from the origin to the point <m>(3,4)</m>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig-rectangular-and-complex-visualization">
            <caption>Two ways to visualize the point <m>(3,4)</m>. In rectangular coordinates, it is represented as a dot. As a complex number, it is represented as an arrow pointing from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(3,4)</m>.</caption>

        <p>
            Complex numbers are very useful in describing things with circular motion, such as circles.
            Unfortunately, these types of models are just outside the scope of this course, but only barely.
            In fact, as you will see in a later course, we can use complex numbers to define a circle using a function, which is something we cannot do with rectangular coordinates.
