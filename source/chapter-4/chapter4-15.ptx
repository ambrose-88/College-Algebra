      <title>Minimizing the Distance from a Point to a Parabola</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the minimum distance between the parabola <m>y = x^2</m> and the point <m>(0, 3)</m>.

      <answer>
        <p>
          The minimum distance is (placeholder) from .
        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>(x, x^2)</m> be a point on the parabola. The distance between this point and <m>(0, 3)</m> is given by
          <me>D = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (x^2 - 3)^2}.</me>
          Since distance is always positive, minimizing <m>D</m> is equivalent to minimizing <m>D^2.</m> 
          Therefore, we need to minimize <me>D^2 = (x-0)^2 + (x^2 - 3)^2.</me>
          <m> = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 + x^2 = x^4 - 5x^2 + 9.</m>  
          Let <m>u = x^2</m>, giving <m>D^2 = u^2 - 5u + 9.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          This quadratic in <m>u</m> opens upward, so its minimum occurs at <m>u = \frac{5}{2}</m>.  
          Therefore, <m>x^2 = \frac{5}{2}</m>, giving <m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The closest points on the parabola are <m>\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}, \frac{5}{2}\right)</m> and <m>\left(-\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}, \frac{5}{2}\right)</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The height function <m>h(t) = -16t^2 + 40t + 3</m> is a downward-opening parabola.  
          The time of the maximum height occurs at the vertex, given by

        </p>

        <p>
          Substitute <m>t = 1.25</m> into the height equation:
          <me>h(1.25) = -16(1.25)^2 + 40(1.25) + 3 = -25 + 50 + 3 = 28 \text{ feet.}</me>

          Find its initial velocity and launch height assuming it follows the standard projectile model.
        </p>

      <answer>
        <p>
          The rocket was launched from a height of <m>300</m> feet with an initial velocity of <m>160</m> ft/s.
        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Using the height equation <m>h(t) = -16t^2 + v_0t + h_0</m>, we know that at the vertex, <m>t = 5</m> and <m>h = 700</m>.
          The vertex formula gives <m>t = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{v_0}{32}</m>.  
          Substituting <m>t = 5</m> gives <m>v_0 = 160</m> ft/s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Substituting into the height equation:
          <me>700 = -16(5)^2 + 160(5) + h_0.</me>
          Simplify to get <m>700 = -400 + 800 + h_0</m>, so <m>h_0 = 300</m>.

      <title>Maximizing Profit in Game Design</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A mobile game sells for <m>\$1.00</m> and attracts <m>50{,}000</m> downloads.  
          For every <m>\$0.10</m> increase in price, downloads decrease by <m>2{,}000</m>.  
          Find the price that maximizes the studioâ€™s total revenue.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The price that maximizes revenue is <m>\$1.75</m>, yielding approximately <m>35{,}000</m> downloads.
        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> represent the number of <m>\$0.10</m> increases.  
          Then the price is <m>p = 1 + 0.1x</m>, and the number of downloads is <m>n = 50{,}000 - 2{,}000x</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Revenue is <m>R = p \times n = (1 + 0.1x)(50{,}000 - 2{,}000x).</m>  
          Expanding gives <m>R = 50{,}000 + 3{,}000x - 200x^2.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          This quadratic opens downward, so its maximum occurs at <m>x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-3{,}000}{2(-200)} = 7.5.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          The optimal price is <m>1 + 0.1(7.5) = \$1.75</m>.  
          At this price, the expected downloads are <m>50{,}000 - 2{,}000(7.5) = 35{,}000</m>.

          For every <m>\$0.50</m> increase in price, the shop sells <m>5</m> fewer lattes.  
          Find the price that maximizes daily revenue.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <answer>
        <p>
          The coffee shop should charge <m>\$6.50</m> per latte to maximize daily revenue.
        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> represent the number of <m>\$0.50</m> price increases.  
          Then the price per latte is <m>p = 5 + 0.5x</m>, and the number sold is <m>n = 80 - 5x</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The daily revenue is <m>R = p \times n = (5 + 0.5x)(80 - 5x).</m>  
          Simplify to get <m>R = 400 + 15x - 2.5x^2.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          The maximum occurs at <m>x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-15}{2(-2.5)} = 3.</m>  
          Thus, the optimal price is <m>p = 5 + 0.5(3) = \$6.50</m>.
