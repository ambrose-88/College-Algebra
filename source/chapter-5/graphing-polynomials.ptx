  <statement>
    <p>Graph the function <m>p(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x - 8</m>.</p>
  </statement>

  <answer>
    <figure>
      <caption>The graph of <m>p(x)=x^3+2x^2-4x-8</m>.</caption>

    </figure>
  </answer>

  <solution>
    <p>
      The first step is to determine the end behavior of <m>p(x)</m>. Since the leading term is <m>x^3</m>, 
      the end behavior of <m>p(x)</m> is approximated by the end behavior of <m>x^3</m>. In this case, 
      the graph will end with an arrow rising up and to the right and with an arrow falling down and to the left.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <caption>The end behavior of the function has been drawn, leaving the middle of the graph undrawn at this time.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/degree-three-graph-a.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Next, since the constant term is <m>a_0 = -8</m>, we know that the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,-8)</m>.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <caption>The point <m>(0,-8)</m> has been added to the plot.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/degree-three-graph-b.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Then, solve the equation <m>p(x)=0</m> using factoring by grouping.</p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x) \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2(x+2) - 4(x+2) \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>(x+2)(x^2 - 4) \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>(x+2)(x-2)(x+2) \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>(x+2)^2(x-2) \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>(x+2)^2 \amp= 0 \amp x-2 \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>x+2 \amp= 0 \amp x-2 \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp= -2 \amp x \amp= 2</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, the <m>x</m>-intercepts are <m>(2,0)</m> and <m>(-2,0)</m>. 
      <ul>
      <li><p>Since the zero <m>x=-2</m> has multiplicity <m>2</m>, the graph will bounce at the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>(-2,0)</m> like <m>y=x^2</m>,</p></li> 
      <li><p>since <m>x=2</m> has multiplicity <m>1</m>, it will cross the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>(2,0)</m> like <m>y=x</m>.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <figure>
      <caption>The <m>x</m>-intercepts <m>(2,0)</m> and <m>(-2,0)</m> are added. The graph bounces from below at <m>(-2,0)</m> and crosses from negative to positive at <m>(2,0)</m>.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/degree-three-graph-c.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Since we have zeros at <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=2</m>, we now compute additional points at <m>x=-3,-1,0,1,3</m>:</p>

    <p>
      Since a polynomial cannot have more than <m>n - 1</m> local extrema and our graph has 2 local extrema, we have a complete graph. 
      We connect the points and finish graphing the function.

  <statement>
    <p>Graph the function <m>p(x) = -2x^4 + 10x^2 - 8</m>.</p>
  </statement>

  <answer>
    <figure>
      <caption>The graph of <m>p(x)=-2x^4+10x^2-8</m>.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/degree-four-graph.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>
  </answer>

  <solution>
    <p>
      The first step is to determine the end behavior of <m>p(x)</m>. 
      Since the leading term is <m>-2x^4</m> with a negative coefficient and even degree, both ends of the graph look similar to <m>y=-2x^4</m>. 
      Therefore, the graph travels down and to the right as <m>x</m> approaches <m>+\infty</m>.
      Similarly, the graph travels down and to the left as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-\infty</m>.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <caption>The end behavior is drawn with both ends decreasing.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/degree-four-graph-a.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Next, since the constant term is <m>a_0 = -8</m>, the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,-8)</m>.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <caption>The point <m>(0,-8)</m> has been added to the plot.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/degree-four-graph-b.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Since <m>p(x)</m> is quadratic in form, let <m>u=x^2</m>). Then we can solve for <m>u</m>, and then <m>x</m>, as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x) \amp= -2x^4 + 10x^2 - 8 \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>-2(x^4 - 5x^2 + 4) \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>x^4 - 5x^2 + 4 \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>u^2 - 5u + 4 \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>(u - 4)(u - 1) \amp= 0 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>u \amp= 4 \amp u \amp= 1 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2 \amp= 4 \amp x^2 \amp= 1 \\</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp= \pm 2 \amp x \amp= \pm 1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, the <m>x</m>-intercepts are <m>(-2,0)</m>, <m>(-1,0)</m>, <m>(1,0)</m>, and <m>(2,0)</m>. 
      Each zero has multiplicity <m>1</m>, so the graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis like <m>y=x</m> at each intercept.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <caption>The <m>x</m>-intercepts <m>(-2,0)</m>, <m>(-1,0)</m>, <m>(1,0)</m>, and <m>(2,0)</m> are added to the graph.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/degree-four-graph-c.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Because <m>p(x)</m> is an even function (only even powers of <m>x</m> appear), 
      its graph is symmetric with respect to the <m>y</m>-axis. 
      We therefore only need to compute values for positive <m>x</m> and reflect them for negative <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <p>Let us compute values at <m>x=0.5</m>, <m>x=1.5</m>, and <m>x=2.25</m>:</p>

    <table xml:id="selected-points-degree-four">
      <title>Selected Points for <m>p(x)=-2x^4+10x^2-8</m></title>
      <tabular>

        </row>
      </tabular>
    </table>

    <p>Using the fact that <m>p(x)</m> is an even function, we see that the points <m>(-0.5,-5.625)</m>, <m>(-1.5,4.375)</m>, and <m>(-2.25,-8.633)</m><fn>approximately</fn>.
        We plot all these points in the following figure.</p>

      <image source="chapter-5/degree-four-graph-d.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Because a degree-<m>4</m> polynomial can have at most <m>3</m> turning points and our sketch is consistent with this bound, 
      the graph is complete. Connect the points smoothly to finish the graph of <m>p(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <caption>The graph of <m>p(x)=-2x^4+10x^2-8</m>.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/degree-four-graph.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>
  </solution>
</example>

<p>Consider the following graph of <m>p(x)=x^3-3x-2</m>.</p>

<figure>
  <caption>The graph of <m>p(x)=x^3-3x-2</m>.</caption>
  <image source="chapter-5/hard-degree-three-graph.png" decorative="yes" width="50%">
    <shortdescription>Graph of p(x) = x^3 - 3x - 2</shortdescription>
  </image>
</figure>

<p>
  While it is clear from the graph that we have two <m>x</m>-intercepts: <m>(-1,0)</m> and <m>(2,0)</m>, try to solve
  <m>x^3-3x-2=0</m> using any of the techniques we have learned so far. You will see that they all fail.
  Furthermore, the polynomial factors nicely as <m>p(x)=(x-2)(x+1)^2</m>. Again, no factoring technique we have learned will factor this polynomial.
</p>

<p>
  Our next goal is to develop a factoring method that can factor polynomials such as <m>x^3-3x-2</m>.
  Once we have established that method, we can then find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of <m>p(x)=x^3-3x-2</m>.
  This technique will have a side effect: we will end up with a result known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
