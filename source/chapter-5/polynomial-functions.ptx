  <title>Polynomial Function</title>

  <statement>
    <p>
        Let <m>a_n</m>, <m>a_{n-1}</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_0</m> be any real numbers with <m>a_n \ne 0</m> and an integer <m>n\geq 0</m>. 
        The <term>standard form of a polynomial function</term> is any function of the form <me>p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0</me>
        There are four important definitions related to polynomial functions that we will use in Chapters 5 and 6.
      <ul>
        <li><p>The highest power of <m>x</m> is called the <term>degree</term> of the polynomial function. The degree of a generic function is denoted as <m>n</m>.</p></li>       
        <li><p>The term containing the highest power of <m>x</m> is called the <term>leading term</term>. The leading term of a generic polynomial function is denoted as <m>a_n x^n</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p><m>a_n</m> is called the <term>leading coefficient</term>.</p></li>
        <li><p>The term without any variables is called the <term>constant term</term>. The constant term of a generic polynomial is denoted as <m>a_0</m>.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>
<p>Before exploring the properties of polynomial functions, we need to be able to identify which functions are polynomials.</p>

<example xml:id="identifying-polynomial-functions">
  <title>Identifying Polynomial Functions</title>
  <statement>
    <p>Which of the following functions are polynomial?
    <ul>
      <li><p><m>p(x) = 7x^3 + 8x^2 + 2x - 1</m></p></li>
      <li><p><m>q(x) = 8</m></p></li>
      <li><p><m>r(x) = 8x^{-2} + 3x^{-1} + 4</m></p></li>
      <li><p><m>s(x) = 12x + 4\sqrt{x} + 2</m></p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>This is a polynomial function with <m>a_3 = 7</m>, <m>a_2 = 8</m>, <m>a_1 = 2</m>, and <m>a_0 = -1</m>.</p></li>
      <li><p>This is a polynomial function with <m>a_0 = 8</m>.</p></li>
      <li><p>While this function is quadratic-in-form, this function is not a polynomial function since the exponents are not integers.</p></li>
      <li><p>While this function is quadratic-in-form, this is not a polynomial function since a variable appears under a square root.</p></li>
    </ul>
</p>
  </solution>
</example>
<p>Now that we have a sense of which functions are polynomials, we need to be able to identify the degree, leading term, leading coefficient, and the constant term at a glance since features of the polynomial determine many (but not all) of the important features of its graph.</p>

  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
        Although polynomial terms are usually written from highest to lowest degree, this order is a matter of convention, not a mathematical requirement. 
        Only certain techniques, such as polynomial long division or synthetic division, rely on that order. 
        Therefore, do not assume the leading or constant terms will always appear first and last.</p>

  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>Every real number <m>a_0</m> can be written as <m>a_0 x^0</m> since <m>x^0 = 1</m>. Therefore, horizontal lines such as <m>f(x) = 12</m> are also degree 0 polynomials, since the highest power of <m>x</m> is 0.</p>

  <title>Identifying the Key Parts of a Factored Polynomial</title>

  <statement>
    <p>Let <m>p(x)=4(x-2)^2(x-1)^3.</m> Find the degree, leading term, and constant term.</p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      While this seems harder, the solution is very straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we find the leading term by ignoring the <m>-2</m> and <m>-1</m> in the factors to get the product
      <me>4\cdot(x)^2\cdot(x)^3=4x^5.</me>
      Now that we have the leading term, we see that the degree is <m>5</m> and the leading coefficient is <m>4</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To find the constant term, we just ignore the <m>x</m> in each factor and multiply to get
      <me>4\cdot(-2)^2\cdot(-1)^3=-16.</me>
    </p>
  </solution>
