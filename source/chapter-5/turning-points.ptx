    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>turning points</term> of a polynomial function <m>p</m> are the local extrema of the function.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Why do we call the local extrema of the function turning points? Think of the graph as a road twisting through the countryside. At certain points, we have to turn to the left or right and make a sharp turn. The graph of the function does this as well: instead of turning left and right, we are turning sharply from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. The turning point is just the sharpest point in the turn.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike quadratic functions, the local extrema of a function are typically hard to find using algebra alone. 
    This implies that the turning points of a polynomial function are hard to find. 
    In fact, most turning points require calculus in order to find their exact coordinates.
    But, even if we can't calculate the points exactly, there are still somethings we can still say about turning points, as the following theorem shows.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>p</m> be a degree <m>n</m> polynomial function. Then there are at most <m>n-1</m> turning points.
