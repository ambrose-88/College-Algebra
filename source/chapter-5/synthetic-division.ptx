    <title>Synthetic Division</title>
    <p>Recall that we are looking for a way to factor any polynomial function as <me>p(x)=a_n(x-c_1)(x-c_2)\cdot(x-c_{n-1})(x-c_n)</me>. Since we have seen that there is a relationship between factoring and dividing, notice that all our factors look like <m>x</m> minus a number. So, let’s look at how dividing by <m>x-c</m> and the Division Algorithm work together.</p>

<p>But polynomial long division, as we have seen, can be long, tedious, and cumbersome to write. It turns out that when we divide by <m>x-c</m>, there is a shorthand version of polynomial long division called <term>synthetic division</term> that can make this process faster and less error-prone. Instead of writing a step-by-step method, we will just illustrate how this works in the next three examples.</p>

<example xml:id="synthetic-division-first-example">
  <title>Synthetic Division, First Example</title>

  <statement>
    <p>Use Synthetic Division to divide <m>p(x)=x^3+8x^2+13x+3</m> by <m>d(x)=x+3</m>. Write your final answer using the Division Algorithm.</p>
  </statement>

  <answer>
    <p><me>x^3+8x^2+13x+3=(x^2+5x-2)(x+3)+9</me></p>
  </answer>

  <solution>
    <p>First, we need to write the value of <m>c</m> and box it off. In this case, since <me>x+3=x-(-3)=x-c</me> we have that <m>c=-3</m>. Therefore, we write <m>-3</m> and the box as follows.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write down <m>-3</m> and enclose it on the right and bottom sides.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-a.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Next, we write the coefficients of <m>p(x)</m> in order from the highest degree term to the lowest degree term. If a degree is missing, use a zero as a placeholder.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write down the coefficients of <m>p(x)=x^3+8x^2+13x+3</m>.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-b.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Next, leave some space under the coefficients of <m>p(x)</m>. Then, draw a horizontal line under that space.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write a horizontal line under the coefficients, leaving some space between the numbers and the line for additional information.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-c.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Always bring down the first coefficient and write it below the line.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write the coefficient <m>1</m> below itself under the line.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-d.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Next, multiply <m>-3</m> by <m>1</m> and write the product <m>-3</m> under the <m>8</m>.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write the product <m>-3</m> below the <m>8</m>.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-e.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Add <m>8</m> and <m>-3</m> together to get <m>5</m>. Write this number below the <m>-3</m> and under the line.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write the sum <m>5</m> below the line under <m>-3</m>.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-f.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Next, we multiply <m>-3</m> by <m>5</m> to get <m>-15</m>. We write <m>-15</m> under the <m>13</m>.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write the product <m>-15</m> under <m>13</m>.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-g.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Then, add <m>13</m> to <m>-15</m> to get <m>-2</m>.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write <m>-2</m> below <m>-15</m> and under the line.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-h.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Next, multiply <m>-3</m> by <m>-2</m> to get <m>+6</m>. Write <m>6</m> under the <m>3</m>.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write the product <m>6</m> under <m>3</m>.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example-i.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Finally, add <m>3</m> and <m>6</m> together to get <m>9</m>.</p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Write the sum <m>9</m> under the <m>6</m> and below the line.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-first-example.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Now that the synthetic division is done, we have to use the numbers under the line to construct the quotient <m>q(x)</m> and the remainder <m>r(x)</m>.</p>
    <p>The last number in the row is the remainder; so, we have that <m>r(x)=9</m>.</p>
    <p>The remaining three numbers are the coefficients of <m>q(x)</m>. Since <m>p(x)</m> is degree 3 and we divided by a degree 1 polynomial, the quotient <m>q(x)</m> will be a degree 2 polynomial. Therefore, <m>q(x)=x^2+5x-2</m>.</p>

    <p>Using the Division Algorithm, we have that <me>x^3+8x^2+13x+3=(x^2+5x-2)(x+3)+9</me>.</p>

  </answer>

  <solution>
    <p>First, we need to write the value of <m>c</m> and box it off. In this case, since <me>x-4=x-c</me> we have that <m>c=4</m>. Therefore, we write <m>4</m> and the box as follows.</p>

      <image source="chapter-5/synthetic-second-example-e.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>

    <p>Add <m>-9</m> and <m>8</m> together to get <m>-1</m>. Write this number below the <m>8</m> and under the line.</p>
