                    Let <m>r(x)=\frac{p(x)}{d(x)}</m> be any fully simplified rational function. Then <m>x=c</m> is a zero of <m>r(x)</m> only if it is in the domain of <m>r(x)</m> and a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.

            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>Notice that it is not enough that <m>x=c</m> be a zero of the numerator <m>p(x)</m>; 
            it must also be in the domain of the rational function <m>r(x)</m>. 
            Therefore, if you cancel off <m>x-c</m> from the numerator and denominator when simplifying <m>r(x)</m>, we may not have zero since canceling factors does not affect the domain of the function. 
            </p>
        <p>
            If <m>x=c</m> is not in the domain of <m>r(x)</m> before canceling off <m>x-c</m>, then something else occurs: we will either get a vertical asymptote or a hole in the graph.
        We'll introduce both vertical asymptotes and holes later in this chapter.</p>

                In order to find the zeroes of <m>r(x)</m>, we first need to see if it is fully simplified. We factor the numerator and denominator as follows.
                <md>
                    <mrow>r(x)\amp=\dfrac{x^3-x^2-8x+12}{x^2-3x-4}\\</mrow>
                    <mrow>r(x)\amp=\dfrac{(x-2)^2(x+3)}{(x-4)(x+1)}\\</mrow>
                </md>
                Since there are no common factors, <m>r(x)</m> is fully simplified.  
                Therefore, the zeroes of the numerator are also the zeroes of <m>r(x)</m>.
                By the Factor Theorem, the factors <m>x-2</m> and <m>x+3</m> correspond to the zeroes <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=-3</m>, respectively.

        <solution>
            <p>
                From the previous example, we have already factored <m>r(x)</m> as follows.
                <md>
                    <mrow>r(x)\amp=\dfrac{(x-2)^2(x+3)}{(x-4)(x+1)}\\</mrow>
                </md>
                By the definition of multiplicity for rational functions, since <m>(x-2)^2</m> is a factor of the numerator, the zero <m>x=2</m> has multiplicity <m>2</m>. 
                Similarly, since <m>(x+3)^1</m> is a factor of the numerator, the zero <m>x=-3</m> has multiplicity <m>1</m>.
