    <title>Holes in Rational Functions</title>

<p>So, I kind of told a white lie earlier. The zeroes of the denominator may produce a vertical asymptote, but the zeroes of the denominator can also produce <term>holes</term> in the graph, as we will see in the following theorem.</p>

<note xml:id="holes-graphing-utilities">
  <title>Note</title>
  <p>Most graphing utilities, including the TI-84, do not graph holes by default.</p>

  <title>Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>Let <m>r(x)=\dfrac{p(x)\cdot (x-c)^n}{q(x)\cdot (x-c)^m}</m> be any rational function whose numerator and denominator have a common factor of <m>(x-c)</m>, where the integer <m>m\geq 1</m> and the integer <m>n\geq 0</m>.</p>
    <p>Then <m>r(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=c</m> since we cannot divide by zero, but comparing the multiplicities of <m>x=c</m> in the numerator and denominator can still yield information about the behavior of the graph near <m>x=c</m>. There are three different behaviors that can occur, as summarized in the following table.</p>

  <title>Hole vs. Asymptote at <m>x=2</m> (simple)</title>
  <statement>
    <p>Determine if the function <m>r(x)=\dfrac{x}{(x-1)(x-2)}</m> has a hole or a vertical asymptote at <m>x=2</m>.</p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>There is a vertical asymptote <m>x=2</m>.</p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>Since the factor <m>x-2</m> appears only in the denominator, there is no common factor. Therefore, there is a vertical asymptote at <m>x=2</m>.</p>
