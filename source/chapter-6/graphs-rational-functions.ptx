  <title>Procedure</title>

  <p>Let <m>r(x)=\frac{p(x)}{r(x)}</m> be any rational function. Use the following steps to graph the function.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Find the <m>y</m>-intercept (if it exists) and express it as a point <m>(0, r(0))</m>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Factor the numerator and denominator, but do not cancel any factors yet.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Find the zeroes of the denominator (if they exist) and determine the type of behavior (vertical asymptote or hole) for each zero.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Cancel off the common factors.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Determine the end behavior of the function.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Determine if the graph crosses the horizontal, oblique, or nonlinear. Plot any points of intersection.</p>
    </li> 

    <li>
      <p>Find the zeroes of the numerator (if they exist) and their multiplicities.
      <ul>
        <li>Express your <m>x</m>-intercepts as <m>(x,0)</m> and graph them as solid dots unless they correspond to a hole, in which case use an open dot.</li>
        <li>Use the multiplicities to determine whether the graph crosses or bounces at each intercept.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Determine the multiplicities of the remaining zeroes of the denominator. The multiplicities of the denominator determine the graph's behavior near the vertical asymptotes.
      <ul>
        <li>Even multiplicities mean that the graph “bounces off infinity.”</li>
        <li>Odd multiplicities mean that the graph “crosses from positive to negative infinity,” or vice versa.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </li>

    
    <li>
      <p>Use the intercepts, end behavior, and multiplicities to draw a general sketch of the graph. Plot additional points as needed to further define the shape of the graph.</p>
    </li>

  <solution>
    <p>
      We follow the steps from the above procedure to graph the function. First, we find the <m>y</m>-intercept by evaluating <m>r(0)</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>r(0)\amp=\dfrac{0-2}{(0+1)(0-2)(0-3)^2}\\</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=\dfrac{-2}{(1)(-2)(9)}\\</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=\dfrac{-2}{-18}\\</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=\dfrac{1}{9}\\</mrow>
            </md>
            Thus, the <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>(0, \frac{1}{9})</m>.</p>
            <figure>
              <caption>The graph of the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>\left(0, \frac{1}{9}\right)</m></caption>
              <image source="chapter-6/graphing-rational-function-a.png" decorative="yes" width="50%" />
            </figure>
    <p>Next, we observe that both the numerator and denominator are already factored. By the Factor Theorem, we know that the zeroes are <m>x=-1</m>, <m>x=2</m>, and <m>x=3</m>.
      Therefore, the domain in interval notation is <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (-1, 2) \cup (2, 3) \cup (3, \infty)</m>.</p>
      <p>Now, we cancel off the common factor of <m>x-2</m> from the numerator and denominator.
            <md>
              <mrow>r(x)\amp=\dfrac{x-2}{(x+1)(x-2)(x-3)^2}\\</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=\dfrac{1}{(x+1)(x-3)^2}\amp x\amp\ne 2\\</mrow>
            </md>
            Therefore, we know we have a hole at <m>x=2</m>, and there are two vertical asymptotes: the vertical lines <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=3</m>. To find the value of the hole, we evaluate the simplified version of <m>r(x)</m> at <m>x=2</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>r(2)\amp=\dfrac{1}{(2+1)(2-3)^2}\\</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=\dfrac{1}{(3)(-1)^2}\\</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=\dfrac{1}{3}\\</mrow>
            </md>
            This calculation implies that the hole is at the point <m>(2, \frac{1}{3})</m>.</p>
            <figure>
              <caption>The graph of the hole <m>(2, \frac{1}{3})</m> and the vertical asymptotes <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=3</m> are added to the graph.</caption>
              <image source="chapter-6/graphing-rational-function-b.png" decorative="yes" width="50%" />
            </figure>
    <p>Next, we determine the end behavior of the function. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is <m>y=0</m> (aka the <m>x</m>-axis). To find if the graph crosses the horizontal asymptote, set <m>r(x)=0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>r(x) \amp = 0\\</mrow>
        <mrow>\dfrac{1}{(x+1)(x-3)^2} \amp = 0\\</mrow>
        <mrow>1 \amp = 0\\</mrow>
      </md>
      Since this equation has no solution, the graph does not cross the horizontal asymptote. This calculation also implies that there are no <m>x</m>-intercepts.</p>
      <figure>
        <caption>The end behavior of the function is added to the graph.</caption>
        <image source="chapter-6/graphing-rational-function-c.png" decorative="yes" width="50%" />
      </figure>
    <p>Next, we determine the multiplicities of zeroes of the denominator. The factor <m>x+1</m> has multiplicity 1. This implies that the graph crosses at infinity at <m>x=-1</m>.</p>
    <p> The factor <m>x-3</m> has multiplicity 2, which implies that the graph bounces off infinity at <m>x=3</m>.</p>
    <figure>
      <caption>The behavior near the vertical asymptotes are added to the graph.</caption>
      <image source="chapter-6/graphing-rational-function-d.png" decorative="yes" width="50%" />
    </figure>
    <p>We now have enough information to sketch in the rest of the graph.</p>
    <figure>
        <caption>The graph of <m>r(x) = \dfrac{x-2}{(x+1)(x-2)(x-3)^2}</m></caption>
        <image source="chapter-6/graphing-rational-function.png" decorative="yes" width="50%" />
