<title>Graphing Points on the Coordinate Plane</title>
<introduction>
  <p>In the last section, we reviewed terminology related to coordinate planes. 
    In this section, we will demonstrate how to graph points.  
    We will draw points by hand, and we will use technology to plot points. We will build upon this skill when we learn how to graph equations and functions.</p>

    <title>Graphing a Point by Hand</title>

        <title>Positive and Negative Signs as Directions of Travel.</title>
        <p>
            When graphing on a number line, all the numbers to the right of 0 are positive, and all the numbers to the left of 0 are negative. 
            To understand why we label the number line this way, think of a car parked at <m>x=0</m> on an infinite straight road. <m>x=0</m> is the <term>starting point</term> (also known as the <term>reference point</term>); it is where the car is located before we start measuring how far it travels. 
            The positive numbers indicate how many miles forward the car travels from the starting point; the negative numbers indicate how many miles backward the car travels in reverse from the starting point.
        </p>

            <caption>Positive numbers always indicate the forward direction of travel. 
                No matter its position, the car is always facing to the right.</caption>

        <p>Unlike a number line, the coordinate plane uses two number lines—one horizontal and one vertical. 
            Each axis has a positive (forward) and negative (backward) direction. 
            On a standard coordinate plane, moving to the right (east) is the positive horizontal direction, and moving up (north) is the positive vertical direction. 
            An ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m> tells you how far and in which direction to travel along each axis. 
            The number tells you how far to travel, and the sign of the number tells you which direction to travel. 
            For example, the point <m>(-3,2)</m> means that—starting at the origin—you need to move 3 units to the left and 2 units up.</p>

            <title>Graphing a Point By Hand</title>
            <p>When we look at our rectangle example for <m>(3,4)</m> from the last section, notice that there were two ways we could travel the perimeter of the rectangle to reach the point. 
                We could travel 3 along the south edge, and then go up by 4 along the east edge. 
                This is the standard way to plot the point. 
                Equivalently, we could have gone up 4 along the west edge, then traveled 3 along the north edge. 
                While technically not the standard method, there is no harm in plotting a point this way. 
                It can be shown any point on the rectangular coordinate plane can be reached using either method.

            <title>Using Variables Other Than <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.</title>
            <p>
                While using <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is common in mathematics, when working with real-world examples, you may want to use variables to represent the quantities in the problem. 
                Informally, we can even use words or short phrases to represent <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. 
                This is commonly used to label charts and reports.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rectangular coordinate plane is also called the <term><m>xy</m>-plane</term> to emphasize which variable names we are using. 
                When using variable names other than <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, we will use the ><m>xy</m>-plane naming convention, but substitute the variables relevant to the problem context.
            </p>

                    If <m>x</m> is the quantity of items produced by a factory and <m>y</m> is the cost (in thousands of dollars) to produce those items, we could use <m>q</m> instead of <m>x</m> for quantity produced and <m>C</m> instead of <m>y</m> for the cost to produce <m>q</m> items. 
                    Ordered pairs would be <m>(q,C)</m> plotted in the <m>qC</m>-plane.

<p>
    In the study of motion, it is common to represent time and position using variables.
    While mathematics often uses <m>x</m> for time and <m>y</m> for position, physicists
    typically use <m>t</m> to denote time and <m>s</m> to represent the position of an object
    relative to its starting point. Thus, the motion of an object can be described using
    ordered pairs <m>(t, s)</m>, which are plotted in the <m>ts</m>-plane.

    <p>Now that you have seen several examples of how to use other variables, let's try do a full example from psychology.</p>
    <example>
        <title>Psychology</title>
        <statement>
 
  <p>
    In a psychology study, researchers recorded data about participants’ daily screen time and reported stress levels.
    Let <m>x</m> represent the average number of hours of screen time per day, and let <m>y</m> represent the participant’s stress level on a scale from 1 to 10.
  <ul>
    <li>
      What variable names might better represent these quantities than using <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>? What would the ordered pairs be instead of <m>(x, y)</m>? What would we call the <m>xy</m>-plane when we use these variables?
    </li>
    <li>
      Suppose the study reports the point <m>(5, 8)</m>. Interpret this point in the context of the study.
    </li>
    <li>
      One participant reported using screens for 2.5 hours in a day and had a stress level of 4.
      Write this information as a coordinate point. Then graph the point on the same coordinate plane as <m>(5, 8)</m>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        A better variable name for average daily screen time could be <m>h</m> for screen time in hours, and a better variable name for stress level could be <m>S</m> for stress level. 
                        The ordered pairs would be <m>(h,S)</m>, and we would call the <m>hS</m>-plane the screen time-stress level plane.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        
  <p>
    The point <m>(5, 8)</m> means that <m>h = 5</m> and <m>S = 8</m>.
    Therefore, a participant who used screens for an average of 5 hours per day
    reported a stress level of 8 on the 1–10 scale.
  </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
  
<p>
    Since the participant reported an average screen time of 2.5 hours, we have that <m>h = 2.5</m>.
    Their stress level is a 4; therefore, <m>S = 4</m>.
    Since our points are of the form <m>(h, S)</m>, we should use the ordered pair <m>(2.5, 4)</m>
    to represent this individual.
  </p>
</li>
 </ul>
            </p>
