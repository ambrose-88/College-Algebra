  <title>The Distance Formula</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
    Now that we know how to plot points on the coordinate plane, it is natural to ask how far apart two points are.
    There are various ways to measure the distance between two points, and in this course, we are talking about the shortest distance between two points. 
    The shortest distance between two points is given by the Distance Formula. 
    In this section, we will provide a proof of the Distance Formula and use the formula to solve various mathematical and applied problems.

    <title>Distances in the Real World</title>
    
<p>
    In the real world, people can't walk through objects; therefore, taking the shortest path between two points is often impossible.
    Traveling in a town or city is an example of this. Many neighborhoods are laid out in a square grid, and people can only travel
    along the roads which act as the sides of the squares. For example, in the following image, if a person wants to travel from point
    <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m>, they can travel two blocks east and one block north. The total distance traveled is three city blocks.
    This measure of distance is called the <term>Taxicab Metric</term> since it measures the distance a taxicab takes as it takes
    a passenger from point <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m>.

    In mathematics, we often want important concepts to be unique.
    In the Taxicab Metric, the shortest distance is not unique—there are three ways to travel from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> in 3 city blocks.

<p>
    However, the idea of traveling via city blocks does give us enough information to find the shortest distance between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    If we call the intersection where the taxi turns left point <m>C</m>, then the points <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> form the right triangle <m>\triangle ABC</m>.
    This means that side <m>b</m> has length 2 and side <m>a</m> has length 1.

  </figure>

 <p>
    Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for side <m>c</m> — the shortest distance from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>:
    <md>
      <mrow>a^2 + b^2 \amp = c^2</mrow>
      <mrow>1^2 + 2^2 \amp = c^2</mrow>
      <mrow>1 + 4 \amp = c^2</mrow>
      <mrow>5 \amp = c^2</mrow>
      <mrow>\sqrt{5} \amp = c</mrow>
      <mrow>2.236 \amp \approx c</mrow>
    </md>
    Therefore, the shortest distance from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is approximately 2.236 city blocks.

      <title>The Distance Formula</title>

    Let <m>A = (x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>B = (x_2, y_2)</m> be any two points on the coordinate plane.
    The distance <m>d</m> between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is given by the formula

      </statement>
      <proof>
  <p>
    It turns out that the Pythagorean Theorem is the key to finding a general formula for the Distance Formula.
    We are still traveling from point <m>A = (x_1, y_1)</m> to point <m>B = (x_2, y_2)</m>.
    If we draw a horizontal line through <m>A</m> and a vertical line through point <m>B</m>,
    the intersection of the horizontal line and vertical line is the point <m>C = (x_2, y_1)</m>.
    The points <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> also form the right triangle <m>\triangle ABC</m>.
  </p>

    <image source="chapter-1-3/right_triangle.png" width="50%">
    <shortdescription>Right triangle formed by connecting points A, B, and C.</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>

  <p>
    To use the Pythagorean Theorem, we need to measure sides <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of <m>\triangle ABC</m>.
    Fortunately, distances on vertical and horizontal lines are equivalent to finding distances on a number line.
    Since the points <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> are on the same horizontal line, to find the length of side <m>b</m>,
    we find the difference of their first coordinates: <m>b = |x_2 - x_1|</m>.
    Since the points <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are on the same vertical line, to find the length of side <m>a</m>,
    we find the difference of their second coordinates: <m>a = |y_2 - y_1|</m>.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Now, we have all the information required to compute the distance from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
    The following calculation shows us how to compute the distance for any two points:
  </p>

  <p>
    <md>
      <mrow>c^2 \amp = a^2 + b^2</mrow>
      <mrow>c^2 \amp = |x_2 - x_1|^2 + |y_2 - y_1|^2</mrow>
      <mrow>c^2 \amp = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2</mrow>
      <mrow>c \amp = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of drawing a picture and using the Pythagorean Theorem every time we have to compute a distance,
    we can use the final line of the previous calculation to compute the distance directly.
    Since we are calculating a distance, we will use the letter <m>d</m> instead of <m>c</m> in the formula.
  </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <note>
    <p>
      In a problem, it doesn't matter which point you call <m>A</m> and which you call <m>B</m> since
      <m>(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2</m> and <m>(y_1 - y_2)^2 = (y_2 - y_1)^2</m>.
