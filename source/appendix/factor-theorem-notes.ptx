    <p>
      Let <m>p(x) = a_n x^m + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0</m> be any polynomial function.
      Use the following steps to sketch a graph by hand.

        <li><p>Determine the end behavior.</p></li>
        <li><p>Find the <m>y</m>-intercept.</p></li>

<exercise xml:id="lecture-notes-graphing-a-degree-3-polynomial" workspace="5in">
  <title>Graphing a Degree 3 Polynomial</title>
  <statement>
    <p>Graph the function <m>p(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x - 8</m>.</p>
  </statement>
</exercise>

<p>Consider the following graph of <m>p(x)=x^3-3x-2</m>.</p>

<figure>
  <caption>The graph of <m>p(x)=x^3-3x-2</m>.</caption>
  <image source="chapter-5/hard-degree-three-graph.png" decorative="yes" width="50%"/>
</figure>

<p>
  While it is clear from the graph that we have two <m>x</m>-intercepts: <m>(-1,0)</m> and <m>(2,0)</m>, try to solve
  <m>x^3-3x-2=0</m> using any of the techniques we have learned so far. You will see that they all fail.
  Furthermore, the polynomial factors nicely as <m>p(x)=(x-2)(x+1)^2</m>. Again, no factoring technique we have learned will factor this polynomial.

  <title>The Division Algorithm for Natural Numbers</title>
  <statement>
    <p>Let <m>p</m> and <m>d</m> be natural numbers (nonzero, positive, whole numbers). Then there exist two unique numbers, a <term>quotient</term> <m>q</m> and a <term>remainder</term> <m>r</m>, such that <me>p = q\cdot d + r</me>, where <m>r &lt; d</m>.

<p>The Division Algorithm gives us a way to define division in terms of multiplication and addition for any two numbers <m>p</m> and <m>d</m>. We find the values <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> using <term>long division</term>. Our next two examples show us what happens.</p>

<note>
  <p>Don’t confuse the zero polynomial <m>p(x) = 0</m> with solving a polynomial equation <m>p(x) = 0</m>. While the notations are identical, the contexts are very different.

</exercise>

<p>Recall that we are looking for a way to factor any polynomial function as <me>p(x)=a_n(x-c_1)(x-c_2)\cdot(x-c_{n-1})(x-c_n)</me>. Since we have seen that there is a relationship between factoring and dividing, notice that all our factors look like <m>x</m> minus a number. So, let’s look at how dividing by <m>x-c</m> and the Division Algorithm work together.</p>

<p>But polynomial long division, as we have seen, can be long, tedious, and cumbersome to write. It turns out that when we divide by <m>x-c</m>, there is a shorthand version of polynomial long division called <term>synthetic division</term> that can make this process faster and less error-prone. Instead of writing a step-by-step method, we will just illustrate how this works in the next three examples.</p>

  <title>The Factor Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>p(x)</m> be any polynomial function.
      The following two statements are equivalent to each other.
      <ol>
        <li><p><m>x=c</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p><m>x-c</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m>.</p></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<p>
  Since we just proved that factoring is another way to find solutions to polynomial equations,
  <ol>
    <li><p>We don't have to set polynomials equal to zero to solve them; we just need to factor them. This alleviates the confusion between solving an equation and simplifying an expression.</p></li>
    <li><p>If we know a zero of the polynomial, we can use Synthetic or Polynomial Long Division to find the other factor that doesn't correspond to the zero. This helps us factor higher-degree polynomials.</p></li>
