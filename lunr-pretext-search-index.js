  "title": "Graphing Points on the Coordinate Plane",
  "body": " Graphing Points on the Coordinate Plane   Graphing is one of the fundamental tools in Algebra. As visual creatures, humans can see solutions as pictures instead of only letters and numbers on a page. This helps people notice patterns in data that might be difficult to find when it is expressed only as text. Over the course of this semester, there will be a strong focus on understanding and interpreting graphs from both a mathematical and real-world point of view.    Ordered Pairs  Points on a number line are described by a single number. We use notation such as to show a value on the number line; we graph the point by placing a solid dot three spaces to the right of a place labeled 0 on the number line.   The graph of plotted on the number line.   Number line with a point at x=3    When we move to a coordinate plane , we need two numbers to describe a point. One number describes the horizontal (left\/right) movement, and the other describes the vertical (up\/down) movement. In theoretical mathematics, the variable represents horizontal movement, and the variable represents vertical movement. The following definition shows how we represent points on a coordinate plane.    Let and be any real numbers. An ordered pair is a list of numbers, written as , where the order in which you write the numbers matters (e.g. ).    There are additional definitions related to ordered pairs.    Let be an ordered pair.  is known as the x-coordinate (or informally as the first coordinate ).  is known as the y-coordinate (or informally as the second coordinate ).      While coordinates are often written as ordered pairs, they can also be written as a pair of equations. The next two examples show us how to convert from ordered pairs to a pair of equations, and vice versa.   Convert Coordinates to Ordered Pairs   What point corresponds to the pair of equations and ? Express the point as an ordered pair.         Since every point on the coordinate plane can be expressed as an ordered pair , this pair of equations can be represented by the ordered pair .     Convert Ordered Pair to Coordinates   Let the ordered pair represent a point on the coordinate plane.  What are the values for and ?         Since every point on the coordinate plane can be expressed as an ordered pair , then:  - since is the first coordinate.  - since is the second coordinate.      Visualizing The Coordinate Plane   Coordinate Axes  Now that we know how to represent points on a coordinate plane in symbols, we need to know how to visualize the coordinate plane. The coordinate plane uses two number lines called coordinate axes to describe the locations of all the ordered pairs on the coordinate plane. The following procedure describes how to correctly draw the coordinate axes and label them.   Drawing a Coordinate Plane    We start by drawing a number line and label it as . We call this number line the -axis .  Next, we draw another number line that intersects the first line at a right angle and label it as . We call this second number line the -axis .  Finally, we label each axis with a scale. The scale does not necessarily have to be the same on each axis.  The scales determine the coordinate grid , a network of horizontal and vertical lines that helps you determine where points belong on the coordinate plane. Drawing the coordinate grid is optional, but often helpful.     The following figure shows a coordinate plane with the - and -axes labeled and a coordinate grid drawn in.   The coordinate grid is an optional feature of drawing a coordinate plane.    A coordinate plane without a grid   A coordinate plane without a grid.     A coordinate plane with a grid.   A coordinate plane with a grid.       Tip  When learning how to graph on the coordinate plane, use graph paper to help set up your scale and coordinate grid.     The Origin and Rectangular Coordinates  One of the most important points on the coordinate plane is the origin , which is represented by the ordered pair . On many coordinate planes, the origin is where the coordinate axes intersect. But in many real-world problems, the coordinate axes might be visible. We draw a pair of axes that act as stand-ins for the - and -axes, and theses stand-ins will intersect at a point other than the origin. This can help emphasize patterns in data that would be hidden forced the axes and the origin to always appear in our graph.   Coordinate planes may or may not include the axes and origin in the visible region.    The standard view of the coordinate plane. The axes cross at .   The axes always cross at the origin (0,0).     A non-standard view of the coordinate plane. The axes cross at .   The axes cross at (40, 1950) instead of the origin (0,0).      The coordinate plane is often called the rectangular coordinate plane because the origin and any other point form opposite corners of a rectangle. For example, the point refers to rectangle width on the -axis and length on the -axis. But, the point refers to a rectangle with length on the -axis and width on the -axis. This is why the pairs are ordered. Switching the order of and defines a different point on the plane since it defines a different rectangle.   Unique points define unique rectangles in the plane.    The rectangle defined by the point .   The point (3,4) defines a rectangle whose opposite corner is the origin.     The rectangle defined by the point .   The point (4,3) defines a rectangle whose opposite corner is the origin.        The Quadrants of a Coordinate Plane  When the coordinate axes cross at the origin, they create four subregions called quadrants . While quadrants play a minimal role in a course like College Algebra, they are very important in some of the future courses you will take.   Quadrants     Quadrant 1 contains all the points to the right of the -axis ( ) and above the -axis ( ).  Quadrant 2 contains all the points to the left of the -axis ( ) and above the -axis ( ).  Quadrant 3 contains all the points to the left of the -axis ( ) and below the -axis ( ).  Quadrant 4 contains all the points to the right of the -axis ( ) and below the -axis ( ).

Note: If a point lies on either the - or -axis, then it is an intercept and is not part of any quadrant. We will learn more about intercepts in .    Determine In Which Quadrant a Point Lies   Consider the following coordinate plane with a standard scale and the points labeled through . Determine which quadrant each point lies in.

  "body": " Graphing Points on the Coordinate Plane   In the last section, we reviewed terminology related to coordinate planes. In this section, we will demonstrate how to graph points. We will draw points by hand, and we will use technology to plot points. We will build upon this skill when we learn how to graph equations and functions.    Graphing a Point by Hand   Positive and Negative Signs as Directions of Travel.  When graphing on a number line, all the numbers to the right of 0 are positive, and all the numbers to the left of 0 are negative. To understand why we label the number line this way, think of a car parked at on an infinite straight road. is the starting point (also known as the reference point ); it is where the car is located before we start measuring how far it travels. The positive numbers indicate how many miles forward the car travels from the starting point; the negative numbers indicate how many miles backward the car travels in reverse from the starting point.   Positive numbers always indicate the forward direction of travel. No matter its position, the car is always facing to the right.     Negative numbers are like a car driving in reverse. If you are at , then you have driven 3 feet in reverse.   The car is positioned at x = -3 while facing to the right.       Negative numbers are like a car driving in reverse. If you are at , then you have not driven anywhere yet.   The car is positioned at x = 0 while facing to the right.       Negative numbers are like a car driving in reverse. If you are at , then you have driven 3 feet forwards.   The car is positioned at x = 3 while facing to the right.       Unlike a number line, the coordinate plane uses two number lines—one horizontal and one vertical. Each axis has a positive (forward) and negative (backward) direction. On a standard coordinate plane, moving to the right (east) is the positive horizontal direction, and moving up (north) is the positive vertical direction. An ordered pair tells you how far and in which direction to travel along each axis. The number tells you how far to travel, and the sign of the number tells you which direction to travel. For example, the point means that—starting at the origin—you need to move 3 units to the left and 2 units up.   Graph showing how to plot the point by moving left and up from the origin.   A graph showing how to plot the point (-3, 2) by moving left and up from the origin.      Graphing a Point By Hand  When we look at our rectangle example for from the last section, notice that there were two ways we could travel the perimeter of the rectangle to reach the point. We could travel 3 along the south edge, and then go up by 4 along the east edge. This is the standard way to plot the point. Equivalently, we could have gone up 4 along the west edge, then traveled 3 along the north edge. While technically not the standard method, there is no harm in plotting a point this way. It can be shown any point on the rectangular coordinate plane can be reached using either method.   Graph showing two ways to plot the point .

To plot the point, you can either  Travel horizontally by , then move vertically by , or  Travel vertically by , then move horizontally by .

Graphing Points Using Technology  In this course, we will use the Desmos as our graphing calculator. (An app version of Desmos is also available for both Android and iOS.) If you prefer to use a TI-84, you may visit this page to see how to graph points on a TI-84.  Graphing points in Desmos is simple! Type the point into the Input Field, and it will automatically plot it for you. Let replot our points from our last six examples all at once in Desmos.   Plotting Points in Desmos   Plot the points , , , , , and in Desmos.    Type each point on its own separate line in the Input Panel, and the points will automatically plot on the graph.

If you have it typed correctly, it should look like this: The output will render in Desmos like this.   Desmos graph showing the points , , , , , and plotted using list notation.   A screenshot of Desmos with all the points plotted using list notation.        Using Variables Other Than and .  While using and is common in mathematics, when working with real-world examples, you may want to use variables to represent the quantities in the problem. Informally, we can even use words or short phrases to represent and . This is commonly used to label charts and reports.  The rectangular coordinate plane is also called the -plane to emphasize which variable names we are using. When using variable names other than and , we will use the > -plane naming convention, but substitute the variables relevant to the problem context.   Economics   If is the quantity of items produced by a factory and is the cost (in thousands of dollars) to produce those items, we could use instead of for quantity produced and instead of for the cost to produce items. Ordered pairs would be plotted in the -plane.   We can either label the axes with variables or in words    The axes have been labeled and instead of and .   The qC-plane. The q-axis is labeled from 0 to 700 in hundreds. The C-axis is labeled from 0 to 100 by tens.     The -axis is labeled Quantity of Items Produced. The -axis is labeled Cost (in thousands)   The qC-plane. The q-axis is labeled Quantity of Items Produced. The C-axis is labeled Cost (in thousands).         Physics   In the study of motion, it is common to represent time and position using variables. While mathematics often uses for time and for position, physicists typically use to denote time and to represent the position of an object relative to its starting point. Thus, the motion of an object can be described using ordered pairs , which are plotted in the -plane.   We can either label the axes with variables or in words    The axes have been labeled and instead of and .   The ts-plane. The t-axis is labeled from 0 to 10 by 1s. The s-axis is labeled from 0 to 100 by 10s.     The -axis is labeled Time (in seconds). The -axis is labeled Position (in feet).   The ts-plane. The t-axis is labeled Time (in seconds). The s-axis is labeled Position (in feet).         Biology   In a biology experiment, let represent the number of days since a seed was planted, and let be the height of the plant (in centimeters) after days. Ordered pairs would be , plotted in the -plane.   We can either label the axes with variables or in words    The axes have been labeled and instead of and .   The dh-plane. The d-axis is labeled from 0 to 10 by 1s. The h-axis is labeled from 0 to 50 by 5s.     The -axis is labeled Days Since Planted. The -axis is labeled Height (in centimeters).   The dh-plane. The d-axis is labeled Days Since Planted. The h-axis is labeled Height (in centimeters).        Now that you have seen several examples of how to use other variables, let's try do a full example from psychology.   Psychology   In a psychology study, researchers recorded data about participants’ daily screen time and reported stress levels. Let represent the average number of hours of screen time per day, and let represent the participant’s stress level on a scale from 1 to 10.  What variable names might better represent these quantities than using and ? What would the ordered pairs be instead of ? What would we call the -plane when we use these variables?  Suppose the study reports the point . Interpret this point in the context of the study.  One participant reported using screens for 2.5 hours in a day and had a stress level of 4. Write this information as a coordinate point. Then graph the point on the same coordinate plane as .         A better variable name for average daily screen time could be for screen time in hours, and a better variable name for stress level could be for stress level. The ordered pairs would be , and we would call the -plane the screen time-stress level plane.    The point means that and . Therefore, a participant who used screens for an average of 5 hours per day reported a stress level of 8 on the 1–10 scale.    Since the participant reported an average screen time of 2.5 hours, we have that . Their stress level is a 4; therefore, . Since our points are of the form , we should use the ordered pair to represent this individual.         "

  "title": "The Distance Formula",
  "body": " The Distance Formula   Now that we know how to plot points on the coordinate plane, it is natural to ask how far apart two points are. There are various ways to measure the distance between two points, and in this course, we are talking about the shortest distance between two points. The shortest distance between two points is given by the Distance Formula. In this section, we will provide a proof of the Distance Formula and use the formula to solve various mathematical and applied problems.    Distances in the Real World  In the real world, people can't walk through objects; therefore, taking the shortest path between two points is often impossible. Traveling in a town or city is an example of this. Many neighborhoods are laid out in a square grid, and people can only travel along the roads which act as the sides of the squares. For example, in the following image, if a person wants to travel from point to point , they can travel two blocks east and one block north. The total distance traveled is three city blocks. This measure of distance is called the Taxicab Metric since it measures the distance a taxicab takes as it takes a passenger from point to point .   A grid of city blocks with a red line showing the path of a taxicab from point to point .   The taxicab travels two blocks east, turns north, and travels an additional block.    There are a couple problems with the Taxicab Metric.   In mathematics, we often want important concepts to be unique. In the Taxicab Metric, the shortest distance is not unique—there are three ways to travel from to in 3 city blocks.    The three ways to get from to in 3 city blocks.      The three minimum-length paths the taxicab can take.    The taxicab travels two blocks east, then turns north.      The taxicab travels one block east, turns north, and travels an additional block east.      The taxicab travels one block north, and then travels two blocks east.        The shortest distance between points and is the length of the line segment joining them.   A red, dashed line segment connects points A and B.    However, the idea of traveling via city blocks does give us enough information to find the shortest distance between and . If we call the intersection where the taxi turns left point , then the points , , and form the right triangle . This means that side has length 2 and side has length 1.   When we combine with , we get a right triangle.   Right triangle formed by points A, B, and C on a city grid.    Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for side — the shortest distance from to : Therefore, the shortest distance from to is approximately 2.236 city blocks.    Proof of the Distance Formula   The Distance Formula   Let and be any two points on the coordinate plane. The distance between and is given by the formula    Points and with a dashed line segment connecting them. The dashed line segment is labeled with the Distance Formula.   Diagram showing a dashed line joining points A and B. The line is labeled with the Distance Formula.      It turns out that the Pythagorean Theorem is the key to finding a general formula for the Distance Formula. We are still traveling from point to point . If we draw a horizontal line through and a vertical line through point , the intersection of the horizontal line and vertical line is the point . The points , , and also form the right triangle .   formed by connecting the points , , and .   Right triangle formed by connecting points A, B, and C.    To use the Pythagorean Theorem, we need to measure sides and of . Fortunately, distances on vertical and horizontal lines are equivalent to finding distances on a number line. Since the points and are on the same horizontal line, to find the length of side , we find the difference of their first coordinates: . Since the points and are on the same vertical line, to find the length of side , we find the difference of their second coordinates: .   with the formulas and labeling the short and long legs, respectively.   Right triangle with legs labeled using coordinate differences.    Now, we have all the information required to compute the distance from to . The following calculation shows us how to compute the distance for any two points:     Instead of drawing a picture and using the Pythagorean Theorem every time we have to compute a distance, we can use the final line of the previous calculation to compute the distance directly. Since we are calculating a distance, we will use the letter instead of in the formula.     In a problem, it doesn't matter which point you call and which you call since and .    "

Determine if an Equation is Quadratic   Which of the following equations are examples of a quadratic equation?              This is a quadratic equation with , , and .  If we fully simplify this equation, we get:    Since the variable is under the square root, this equation cannot be quadratic.  Since we have a variable in the denominator, this equation cannot be quadratic.        The Zero Product Property  Factoring is the most important tool we have to solve equations and to understand the properties of polynomial and rational functions. Factoring gets a lot of its power from the Zero Product Property. This property allows us to split a factored equation into two or more simpler equations that are easier to solve than the original equation, but we have to satisfy one condition: the factorization must be equal to zero.   The Zero Product Property   Let and be algebraic expressions such that . Then or .    One of the most common issues that occurs is when people try to apply this equation when the non-factored side is nonzero. Let's see what happens in this case when we inappropriately apply this property to the equation .     Now, let's check our work.     Notice that both values of fail the check, which means that neither of them were a solution.

  "title": "The Definition of Complex Numbers",
  "body": " The Definition of Complex Numbers   When you learned numbers, you started off with the Counting (Natural) Numbers . Then you learned about zero and you had access to . Then you learned about negative numbers and expanded your list of numbers to the integers . Then you learned about fractions and expanded your knowledge of numbers to the rational numbers . Finally, you learned about radicals and numbers to expand your knowledge of numbers to the real number system. But your journey is not yet complete. There is one more layer to numbers you will learn in this section: complex numbers.    The Imaginary Number  If we try to solve the equation for , the square root method gives us . But, since we are not allowed to take the square root of negative numbers in the real number system, we simply say there is no solution. But when we say this, we mean there is no real solution; in other words, there is no value of on the real number line that will satisfy this equation.  So what do we know in this case? Well, since no number we have learned about so far can be a solution to , it has to be some other number we have not considered before. Let us call it for imaginary since we just made it up. This implies that , which implies that . This is how we define this number.   Definition of   The imaginary number  is the positive solution to the equation .    Powers of are really easy to calculate, and unlike real numbers, there are only four values you have to memorize since the powers cycle through four unique values.     The pattern continues forever like this. If we look at the first four exponents— —these are the possible remainders you get when you divide an integer by . Notice that the powers of that have the same remainder after dividing the exponent by will have the same value.  Now, we remind you of the following fact.   Divisibility Rule for 4   An integer is divisible by if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by .     Divisibility Rule in Terms of Remainders  In the language above, this means that a number is divisible by if you divide the last two digits by and get a remainder of .   It turns out that this rule also works for remainders as well. Therefore, if we divide the last two digits of a number by and look at the remainder we get, this tells us which power of to use.   Computing Powers of   To evaluate for any positive integer , complete the following steps.  Divide the last two digits of by using long division and determine the remainder. You should get , , , or .   The remainder tells you which power of to use from this list.         Compute a Power of   Compute .         First, we divide the last two digits of the exponent by and determine the remainder.   The long division of by . The remainder is equal to .    Since the remainder is equal to , we have that .      Complex Numbers  Now that we know about the number , we are ready to define complex numbers.   Complex Number   Let and be any real numbers. A complex number is any number of the form .    Do complex numbers really exist? The symbol was given the epithet “imaginary” since some mathematicians debated their existence before complex numbers were firmly established as a legitimate number system. It turns out that complex numbers are just another way to describe points in the coordinate plane. For example, the point can also be represented by the complex number . But there is a subtle difference. Instead of thinking of it as the corner of a rectangle, we think of as an arrow pointing from the origin to the point .   Two ways to visualize the point . In rectangular coordinates, it is represented as a dot. As a complex number, it is represented as an arrow pointing from to .   An arrow labeled 3+4i points from the origin to the point (3,4).    Complex numbers are very useful in describing things with circular motion, such as circles. Unfortunately, these types of models are just outside the scope of this course, but only barely. In fact, as you will see in a later course, we can use complex numbers to define a circle using a function, which is something we cannot do with rectangular coordinates.   "

  "title": "The Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function",
  "body": " The Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function   Writing Quadratic Equations in Vertex Form   The Standard Form of a Quadratic   The standard form of a quadratic function is    The standard form of a quadratic function is not very useful since the majority of its features, like its vertex and axis of symmetry, are not baked into the algebraic expression . So, while the standard form is useful for solving equations in one variable, it is not as useful when set equal to instead of 0. Using the theory of transformations from Chapter 7, mathematicians discovered that the vertex form of the function is the correct way to encapsulate all the important information of the graph.   The Vertex Form and Related Information   Let be a quadratic function in standard form. The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by where and are the coordinates for the vertex of the function.  There are two important definitions related to the vertex form.  The vertex of the parabola is the absolute minimum (when ) or the absolute maximum (when ) of the function. Note that the vertex is both a local and absolute extremum.  The axis of symmetry of a parabola is the vertical line that divides the parabola into two mirror images. Every point on one side of this line has a corresponding point on the other side that is the same distance from the line.     The graph of a generic parabola with the vertex and axis of symmetry labeled. Two mirrored points are labeled, and the distances from the points to the axis of symmetry are shown as equal.    An upwards-facing parabola.   A labeled, upwards-facing parabola.     A downwards-facing parabola.   A labeled, downwards-facing parabola.        There are two methods for finding the vertex form from the standard form. The first one uses completing the square to accomplish the transformation.   Using Completing the Square to Convert from Standard to Vertex Form   Convert to vertex form.             While completing the square gets the job done, it is very cumbersome and time-consuming to do. It would be nice to have a formula for the and in the vertex formula. If we complete the square on , we get     This tells us that     But, notice what happens when we evaluate     Therefore, the pair of formula you should use and memorize is      Formula for the Vertex of a Parabola   Let be a quadratic function. Then the formula for the vertex is     We can also rewrite this as the pair of equations    While these formulas still look unwieldy in this form, in practice they are very easy to use.   Using the Formula for and to find the Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function   Write in vertex form.       Since and , we have that     Then, evaluate to find the value of :     Therefore, the vertex form is         Graphing Quadratic Functions Using the Vertex Form  The vertex form gives us enough information to easily graph any quadratic function.   Graphing Quadratic Functions   Let be a quadratic function in vertex form. Perform the following steps to plot its graph.    Plot the vertex .  To find another point, add to and add to . Then plot the point.  To find an additional point, add to and add to . Then plot the point.  Use the axis of symmetry to find and plot the last two points.  Draw a parabola through all five points.       How to Graph a Quadratic Function,   Graph the function .     The graph of with vertex and axis of symmetry .      First, we note that and . Using the formula for , we get:     Next, we compute the value of :     Therefore, we know the vertex is and the axis of symmetry is the vertical line . We start the graph by plotting the vertex and axis of symmetry.   The graph of and .     Next, we compute two additional points. The first point is:     and the second point is:     We plot these two points as well.   The points and are added to the previous graph.     Next, we find the two mirrored points. They will have the same -coordinates as and , but the -coordinates will be and , respectively. Therefore, the mirrored points are and . We plot these additional points.   The points and are added to the previous graph.    Finally, we connect all the points with a parabola to get the final graph.   The graph of with vertex and axis of symmetry .        How to Graph a Quadratic Function,   Graph the function .     The graph of with vertex and axis of symmetry .      First, identify the coefficients and . Using the formula for , we get:     Next, compute :     The vertex is and the axis of symmetry is the vertical line . Begin the graph by plotting the vertex and axis of symmetry.   The vertex and axis are plotted.    Now compute two additional points one and two units to the right of the vertex:        Plot these two points.   The points and are added.    Reflect across the axis to obtain the mirrored points:     Plot these mirrored points as well.   The reflected points and are added.    Finally, connect the points with a smooth downward-opening parabola to obtain the final graph.   The graph of with vertex and axis of symmetry .        Graphing Quadratic Functions Using Intercepts  While the previous method always works, it requires you to remember some unusual formulas. When the parabola crosses the -axis, you can instead use the vertex, the -intercept, and the -intercepts to plot key points. The next example shows how to do this.   How to Graph a Quadratic Function Using Intercepts   Graph the function     The graph of , the vertex , and the intercepts , , and .      Since and , we use the formulas for and to find the vertex.        Therefore, the vertex is . To find the -intercepts, we use the quadratic formula:        Therefore, the -intercepts are and . To find the -intercept, we evaluate :   Therefore, the -intercept is . We then plot all four points and sketch the parabola through them to obtain the graph.

Put a plus sign between each pair of terms. All negative or minus signs come into the parentheses with the number.  Factor out the GCF from each grouped pair.  The binomial left behind after factoring out the GCF should be the same for each term. If it is not, repeat steps 1 and 2 until you get a common binomial.  Factor out the common binomial.  Perform any additional factoring needed until you get a complete factorization.  Use the Zero Product Property to finish solving the problem.     "

The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by where and are the coordinates for the vertex of the function.  There are two important definitions related to the vertex form.    The vertex of the parabola is the absolute minimum (when ) or the absolute maximum (when ) of the function. Note that the vertex is both a local and absolute extremum.  The axis of symmetry of a parabola is the vertical line that divides the parabola into two mirror images. Every point on one side of this line has a corresponding point on the other side that is the same distance from the line.     The graph of a generic parabola with the vertex and axis of symmetry labeled. Two mirrored points are labeled, and the distances from the points to the axis of symmetry are shown as equal.    An upwards-facing parabola.   A labeled, upwards-facing parabola with vertex and axis of symmetry.     A downwards-facing parabola.
