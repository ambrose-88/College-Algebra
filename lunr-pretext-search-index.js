  "title": "Graphing Points on the Coordinate Plane",
  "body": " Graphing Points on the Coordinate Plane   Graphing is one of the fundamental tools in Algebra. As visual creatures, humans can see solutions as pictures instead of only letters and numbers on a page. This helps people notice patterns in data that might be difficult to find when it is expressed only as text. Over the course of this semester, there will be a strong focus on understanding and interpreting graphs from both a mathematical and real-world point of view.    Ordered Pairs  Points on a number line are described by a single number. We use notation such as to show a value on the number line; we graph the point by placing a solid dot three spaces to the right of a place labeled 0 on the number line.   The graph of plotted on the number line.   Number line with a point at x=3    When we move to a coordinate plane , we need two numbers to describe a point. One number describes the horizontal (left\/right) movement, and the other describes the vertical (up\/down) movement. In theoretical mathematics, the variable represents horizontal movement, and the variable represents vertical movement. The following definition shows how we represent points on a coordinate plane.    Let and be any real numbers. An ordered pair is a list of numbers, written as , where the order in which you write the numbers matters (e.g. ).    There are additional definitions related to ordered pairs.    Let be an ordered pair.  is known as the x-coordinate (or informally as the first coordinate ).  is known as the y-coordinate (or informally as the second coordinate ).      While coordinates are often written as ordered pairs, they can also be written as a pair of equations. The next two examples show us how to convert from ordered pairs to a pair of equations, and vice versa.   Convert Coordinates to Ordered Pairs   What point corresponds to the pair of equations and ? Express the point as an ordered pair.         Since every point on the coordinate plane can be expressed as an ordered pair , this pair of equations can be represented by the ordered pair .     Convert Ordered Pair to Coordinates   Let the ordered pair represent a point on the coordinate plane.  What are the values for and ?         Since every point on the coordinate plane can be expressed as an ordered pair , then:  - since is the first coordinate.  - since is the second coordinate.      Visualizing The Coordinate Plane   Coordinate Axes  Now that we know how to represent points on a coordinate plane in symbols, we need to know how to visualize the coordinate plane. The coordinate plane uses two number lines called coordinate axes to describe the locations of all the ordered pairs on the coordinate plane. The following procedure describes how to correctly draw the coordinate axes and label them.   Drawing a Coordinate Plane    We start by drawing a number line and label it as . We call this number line the -axis .  Next, we draw another number line that intersects the first line at a right angle and label it as . We call this second number line the -axis .  Finally, we label each axis with a scale. The scale does not necessarily have to be the same on each axis.  The scales determine the coordinate grid , a network of horizontal and vertical lines that helps you determine where points belong on the coordinate plane. Drawing the coordinate grid is optional, but often helpful.     The following figure shows a coordinate plane with the - and -axes labeled and a coordinate grid drawn in.   The coordinate grid is an optional feature of drawing a coordinate plane.    A coordinate plane without a grid   A coordinate plane without a grid.     A coordinate plane with a grid.   A coordinate plane with a grid.       Tip  When learning how to graph on the coordinate plane, use graph paper to help set up your scale and coordinate grid.     The Origin and Rectangular Coordinates  One of the most important points on the coordinate plane is the origin , which is represented by the ordered pair . On many coordinate planes, the origin is where the coordinate axes intersect. But in many real-world problems, the coordinate axes might be visible. We draw a pair of axes that act as stand-ins for the - and -axes, and theses stand-ins will intersect at a point other than the origin. This can help emphasize patterns in data that would be hidden forced the axes and the origin to always appear in our graph.   Coordinate planes may or may not include the axes and origin in the visible region.    The standard view of the coordinate plane. The axes cross at .   The axes always cross at the origin (0,0).     A non-standard view of the coordinate plane. The axes cross at .   The axes cross at (40, 1950) instead of the origin (0,0).      The coordinate plane is often called the rectangular coordinate plane because the origin and any other point form opposite corners of a rectangle. For example, the point refers to rectangle width on the -axis and length on the -axis. But, the point refers to a rectangle with length on the -axis and width on the -axis. This is why the pairs are ordered. Switching the order of and defines a different point on the plane since it defines a different rectangle.   Unique points define unique rectangles in the plane.    The rectangle defined by the point .   The point (3,4) defines a rectangle whose opposite corner is the origin.     The rectangle defined by the point .   The point (4,3) defines a rectangle whose opposite corner is the origin.        The Quadrants of a Coordinate Plane  When the coordinate axes cross at the origin, they create four subregions called quadrants . While quadrants play a minimal role in a course like College Algebra, they are very important in some of the future courses you will take.   Quadrants     Quadrant 1 contains all the points to the right of the -axis ( ) and above the -axis ( ).  Quadrant 2 contains all the points to the left of the -axis ( ) and above the -axis ( ).  Quadrant 3 contains all the points to the left of the -axis ( ) and below the -axis ( ).  Quadrant 4 contains all the points to the right of the -axis ( ) and below the -axis ( ).

Note: If a point lies on either the - or -axis, then it is an intercept and is not part of any quadrant. We will learn more about intercepts in .    Determine In Which Quadrant a Point Lies   Consider the following coordinate plane with a standard scale and the points labeled through . Determine which quadrant each point lies in.

  "body": " Graphing Points on the Coordinate Plane   In the last section, we reviewed terminology related to coordinate planes. In this section, we will demonstrate how to graph points. We will draw points by hand, and we will use technology to plot points. We will build upon this skill when we learn how to graph equations and functions.    Graphing a Point by Hand   Positive and Negative Signs as Directions of Travel.  When graphing on a number line, all the numbers to the right of 0 are positive, and all the numbers to the left of 0 are negative. To understand why we label the number line this way, think of a car parked at on an infinite straight road. is the starting point (also known as the reference point ); it is where the car is located before we start measuring how far it travels. The positive numbers indicate how many miles forward the car travels from the starting point; the negative numbers indicate how many miles backward the car travels in reverse from the starting point.   Positive numbers always indicate the forward direction of travel. No matter its position, the car is always facing to the right.     Negative numbers are like a car driving in reverse. If you are at , then you have driven 3 feet in reverse.   The car is positioned at x = -3 while facing to the right.       Negative numbers are like a car driving in reverse. If you are at , then you have not driven anywhere yet.   The car is positioned at x = 0 while facing to the right.       Negative numbers are like a car driving in reverse. If you are at , then you have driven 3 feet forwards.   The car is positioned at x = 3 while facing to the right.       Unlike a number line, the coordinate plane uses two number lines—one horizontal and one vertical. Each axis has a positive (forward) and negative (backward) direction. On a standard coordinate plane, moving to the right (east) is the positive horizontal direction, and moving up (north) is the positive vertical direction. An ordered pair tells you how far and in which direction to travel along each axis. The number tells you how far to travel, and the sign of the number tells you which direction to travel. For example, the point means that—starting at the origin—you need to move 3 units to the left and 2 units up.   Graph showing how to plot the point by moving left and up from the origin.   A graph showing how to plot the point (-3, 2) by moving left and up from the origin.      Graphing a Point By Hand  When we look at our rectangle example for from the last section, notice that there were two ways we could travel the perimeter of the rectangle to reach the point. We could travel 3 along the south edge, and then go up by 4 along the east edge. This is the standard way to plot the point. Equivalently, we could have gone up 4 along the west edge, then traveled 3 along the north edge. While technically not the standard method, there is no harm in plotting a point this way. It can be shown any point on the rectangular coordinate plane can be reached using either method.   Graph showing two ways to plot the point .

To plot the point, you can either  Travel horizontally by , then move vertically by , or  Travel vertically by , then move horizontally by .

Graphing Points Using Technology  In this course, we will use the Desmos as our graphing calculator. (An app version of Desmos is also available for both Android and iOS.) If you prefer to use a TI-84, you may visit this page to see how to graph points on a TI-84.  Graphing points in Desmos is simple! Type the point into the Input Field, and it will automatically plot it for you. Let replot our points from our last six examples all at once in Desmos.   Plotting Points in Desmos   Plot the points , , , , , and in Desmos.    Type each point on its own separate line in the Input Panel, and the points will automatically plot on the graph.

If you have it typed correctly, it should look like this: The output will render in Desmos like this.   Desmos graph showing the points , , , , , and plotted using list notation.   A screenshot of Desmos with all the points plotted using list notation.        Using Variables Other Than and .  While using and is common in mathematics, when working with real-world examples, you may want to use variables to represent the quantities in the problem. Informally, we can even use words or short phrases to represent and . This is commonly used to label charts and reports.  The rectangular coordinate plane is also called the -plane to emphasize which variable names we are using. When using variable names other than and , we will use the > -plane naming convention, but substitute the variables relevant to the problem context.   Economics   If is the quantity of items produced by a factory and is the cost (in thousands of dollars) to produce those items, we could use instead of for quantity produced and instead of for the cost to produce items. Ordered pairs would be plotted in the -plane.   We can either label the axes with variables or in words    The axes have been labeled and instead of and .   The qC-plane. The q-axis is labeled from 0 to 700 in hundreds. The C-axis is labeled from 0 to 100 by tens.     The -axis is labeled Quantity of Items Produced. The -axis is labeled Cost (in thousands)   The qC-plane. The q-axis is labeled Quantity of Items Produced. The C-axis is labeled Cost (in thousands).         Physics   In the study of motion, it is common to represent time and position using variables. While mathematics often uses for time and for position, physicists typically use to denote time and to represent the position of an object relative to its starting point. Thus, the motion of an object can be described using ordered pairs , which are plotted in the -plane.   We can either label the axes with variables or in words    The axes have been labeled and instead of and .   The ts-plane. The t-axis is labeled from 0 to 10 by 1s. The s-axis is labeled from 0 to 100 by 10s.     The -axis is labeled Time (in seconds). The -axis is labeled Position (in feet).   The ts-plane. The t-axis is labeled Time (in seconds). The s-axis is labeled Position (in feet).         Biology   In a biology experiment, let represent the number of days since a seed was planted, and let be the height of the plant (in centimeters) after days. Ordered pairs would be , plotted in the -plane.   We can either label the axes with variables or in words    The axes have been labeled and instead of and .   The dh-plane. The d-axis is labeled from 0 to 10 by 1s. The h-axis is labeled from 0 to 50 by 5s.     The -axis is labeled Days Since Planted. The -axis is labeled Height (in centimeters).   The dh-plane. The d-axis is labeled Days Since Planted. The h-axis is labeled Height (in centimeters).        Now that you have seen several examples of how to use other variables, let's try do a full example from psychology.   Psychology   In a psychology study, researchers recorded data about participants’ daily screen time and reported stress levels. Let represent the average number of hours of screen time per day, and let represent the participant’s stress level on a scale from 1 to 10.  What variable names might better represent these quantities than using and ? What would the ordered pairs be instead of ? What would we call the -plane when we use these variables?  Suppose the study reports the point . Interpret this point in the context of the study.  One participant reported using screens for 2.5 hours in a day and had a stress level of 4. Write this information as a coordinate point. Then graph the point on the same coordinate plane as .         A better variable name for average daily screen time could be for screen time in hours, and a better variable name for stress level could be for stress level. The ordered pairs would be , and we would call the -plane the screen time-stress level plane.    The point means that and . Therefore, a participant who used screens for an average of 5 hours per day reported a stress level of 8 on the 1–10 scale.    Since the participant reported an average screen time of 2.5 hours, we have that . Their stress level is a 4; therefore, . Since our points are of the form , we should use the ordered pair to represent this individual.         "

  "title": "The Distance Formula",
  "body": " The Distance Formula   Now that we know how to plot points on the coordinate plane, it is natural to ask how far apart two points are. There are various ways to measure the distance between two points, and in this course, we are talking about the shortest distance between two points. The shortest distance between two points is given by the Distance Formula. In this section, we will provide a proof of the Distance Formula and use the formula to solve various mathematical and applied problems.    Distances in the Real World  In the real world, people can't walk through objects; therefore, taking the shortest path between two points is often impossible. Traveling in a town or city is an example of this. Many neighborhoods are laid out in a square grid, and people can only travel along the roads which act as the sides of the squares. For example, in the following image, if a person wants to travel from point to point , they can travel two blocks east and one block north. The total distance traveled is three city blocks. This measure of distance is called the Taxicab Metric since it measures the distance a taxicab takes as it takes a passenger from point to point .   A grid of city blocks with a red line showing the path of a taxicab from point to point .   The taxicab travels two blocks east, turns north, and travels an additional block.    There are a couple problems with the Taxicab Metric.   In mathematics, we often want important concepts to be unique. In the Taxicab Metric, the shortest distance is not unique—there are three ways to travel from to in 3 city blocks.    The three ways to get from to in 3 city blocks.      The three minimum-length paths the taxicab can take.    The taxicab travels two blocks east, then turns north.      The taxicab travels one block east, turns north, and travels an additional block east.      The taxicab travels one block north, and then travels two blocks east.        The shortest distance between points and is the length of the line segment joining them.   A red, dashed line segment connects points A and B.    However, the idea of traveling via city blocks does give us enough information to find the shortest distance between and . If we call the intersection where the taxi turns left point , then the points , , and form the right triangle . This means that side has length 2 and side has length 1.   When we combine with , we get a right triangle.   Right triangle formed by points A, B, and C on a city grid.    Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for side — the shortest distance from to : Therefore, the shortest distance from to is approximately 2.236 city blocks.    Proof of the Distance Formula   The Distance Formula   Let and be any two points on the coordinate plane. The distance between and is given by the formula    Points and with a dashed line segment connecting them. The dashed line segment is labeled with the Distance Formula.   Diagram showing a dashed line joining points A and B. The line is labeled with the Distance Formula.      It turns out that the Pythagorean Theorem is the key to finding a general formula for the Distance Formula. We are still traveling from point to point . If we draw a horizontal line through and a vertical line through point , the intersection of the horizontal line and vertical line is the point . The points , , and also form the right triangle .   formed by connecting the points , , and .   Right triangle formed by connecting points A, B, and C.    To use the Pythagorean Theorem, we need to measure sides and of . Fortunately, distances on vertical and horizontal lines are equivalent to finding distances on a number line. Since the points and are on the same horizontal line, to find the length of side , we find the difference of their first coordinates: . Since the points and are on the same vertical line, to find the length of side , we find the difference of their second coordinates: .   with the formulas and labeling the short and long legs, respectively.   Right triangle with legs labeled using coordinate differences.    Now, we have all the information required to compute the distance from to . The following calculation shows us how to compute the distance for any two points:     Instead of drawing a picture and using the Pythagorean Theorem every time we have to compute a distance, we can use the final line of the previous calculation to compute the distance directly. Since we are calculating a distance, we will use the letter instead of in the formula.     In a problem, it doesn't matter which point you call and which you call since and .    "

Determine if an Equation is Quadratic   Which of the following equations are examples of a quadratic equation?              This is a quadratic equation with , , and .  If we fully simplify this equation, we get:    Since the variable is under the square root, this equation cannot be quadratic.  Since we have a variable in the denominator, this equation cannot be quadratic.        The Zero Product Property  Factoring is the most important tool we have to solve equations and to understand the properties of polynomial and rational functions. Factoring gets a lot of its power from the Zero Product Property. This property allows us to split a factored equation into two or more simpler equations that are easier to solve than the original equation, but we have to satisfy one condition: the factorization must be equal to zero.   The Zero Product Property   Let and be algebraic expressions such that . Then or .    One of the most common issues that occurs is when people try to apply this equation when the non-factored side is nonzero. Let's see what happens in this case when we inappropriately apply this property to the equation .     Now, let's check our work.     Notice that both values of fail the check, which means that neither of them were a solution.

  "title": "The Definition of Complex Numbers",
  "body": " The Definition of Complex Numbers   When you learned numbers, you started off with the Counting (Natural) Numbers . Then you learned about zero and you had access to . Then you learned about negative numbers and expanded your list of numbers to the integers . Then you learned about fractions and expanded your knowledge of numbers to the rational numbers . Finally, you learned about radicals and numbers to expand your knowledge of numbers to the real number system. But your journey is not yet complete. There is one more layer to numbers you will learn in this section: complex numbers.    The Imaginary Number  If we try to solve the equation for , the square root method gives us . But, since we are not allowed to take the square root of negative numbers in the real number system, we simply say there is no solution. But when we say this, we mean there is no real solution; in other words, there is no value of on the real number line that will satisfy this equation.  So what do we know in this case? Well, since no number we have learned about so far can be a solution to , it has to be some other number we have not considered before. Let us call it for imaginary since we just made it up. This implies that , which implies that . This is how we define this number.   Definition of   The imaginary number  is the positive solution to the equation .    Powers of are really easy to calculate, and unlike real numbers, there are only four values you have to memorize since the powers cycle through four unique values.     The pattern continues forever like this. If we look at the first four exponents— —these are the possible remainders you get when you divide an integer by . Notice that the powers of that have the same remainder after dividing the exponent by will have the same value.  Now, we remind you of the following fact.   Divisibility Rule for 4   An integer is divisible by if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by .     Divisibility Rule in Terms of Remainders  In the language above, this means that a number is divisible by if you divide the last two digits by and get a remainder of .   It turns out that this rule also works for remainders as well. Therefore, if we divide the last two digits of a number by and look at the remainder we get, this tells us which power of to use.   Computing Powers of   To evaluate for any positive integer , complete the following steps.  Divide the last two digits of by using long division and determine the remainder. You should get , , , or .   The remainder tells you which power of to use from this list.         Compute a Power of   Compute .         First, we divide the last two digits of the exponent by and determine the remainder.   The long division of by . The remainder is equal to .    Since the remainder is equal to , we have that .      Complex Numbers  Now that we know about the number , we are ready to define complex numbers.   Complex Number   Let and be any real numbers. A complex number is any number of the form .    Do complex numbers really exist? The symbol was given the epithet “imaginary” since some mathematicians debated their existence before complex numbers were firmly established as a legitimate number system. It turns out that complex numbers are just another way to describe points in the coordinate plane. For example, the point can also be represented by the complex number . But there is a subtle difference. Instead of thinking of it as the corner of a rectangle, we think of as an arrow pointing from the origin to the point .   Two ways to visualize the point . In rectangular coordinates, it is represented as a dot. As a complex number, it is represented as an arrow pointing from to .   An arrow labeled 3+4i points from the origin to the point (3,4).    Complex numbers are very useful in describing things with circular motion, such as circles. Unfortunately, these types of models are just outside the scope of this course, but only barely. In fact, as you will see in a later course, we can use complex numbers to define a circle using a function, which is something we cannot do with rectangular coordinates.   "

  "title": "The Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function",
  "body": " The Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function   Writing Quadratic Equations in Vertex Form   The Standard Form of a Quadratic   The standard form of a quadratic function is    The standard form of a quadratic function is not very useful since the majority of its features, like its vertex and axis of symmetry, are not baked into the algebraic expression . So, while the standard form is useful for solving equations in one variable, it is not as useful when set equal to instead of 0. Using the theory of transformations from Chapter 7, mathematicians discovered that the vertex form of the function is the correct way to encapsulate all the important information of the graph.   The Vertex Form and Related Information   Let be a quadratic function in standard form. The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by where and are the coordinates for the vertex of the function.  There are two important definitions related to the vertex form.  The vertex of the parabola is the absolute minimum (when ) or the absolute maximum (when ) of the function. Note that the vertex is both a local and absolute extremum.  The axis of symmetry of a parabola is the vertical line that divides the parabola into two mirror images. Every point on one side of this line has a corresponding point on the other side that is the same distance from the line.     The graph of a generic parabola with the vertex and axis of symmetry labeled. Two mirrored points are labeled, and the distances from the points to the axis of symmetry are shown as equal.    An upwards-facing parabola.   A labeled, upwards-facing parabola.     A downwards-facing parabola.   A labeled, downwards-facing parabola.        There are two methods for finding the vertex form from the standard form. The first one uses completing the square to accomplish the transformation.   Using Completing the Square to Convert from Standard to Vertex Form   Convert to vertex form.             While completing the square gets the job done, it is very cumbersome and time-consuming to do. It would be nice to have a formula for the and in the vertex formula. If we complete the square on , we get     This tells us that     But, notice what happens when we evaluate     Therefore, the pair of formula you should use and memorize is      Formula for the Vertex of a Parabola   Let be a quadratic function. Then the formula for the vertex is     We can also rewrite this as the pair of equations    While these formulas still look unwieldy in this form, in practice they are very easy to use.   Using the Formula for and to find the Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function   Write in vertex form.       Since and , we have that     Then, evaluate to find the value of :     Therefore, the vertex form is         Graphing Quadratic Functions Using the Vertex Form  The vertex form gives us enough information to easily graph any quadratic function.   Graphing Quadratic Functions   Let be a quadratic function in vertex form. Perform the following steps to plot its graph.    Plot the vertex .  To find another point, add to and add to . Then plot the point.  To find an additional point, add to and add to . Then plot the point.  Use the axis of symmetry to find and plot the last two points.  Draw a parabola through all five points.       How to Graph a Quadratic Function,   Graph the function .     The graph of with vertex and axis of symmetry .      First, we note that and . Using the formula for , we get:     Next, we compute the value of :     Therefore, we know the vertex is and the axis of symmetry is the vertical line . We start the graph by plotting the vertex and axis of symmetry.   The graph of and .     Next, we compute two additional points. The first point is:     and the second point is:     We plot these two points as well.   The points and are added to the previous graph.     Next, we find the two mirrored points. They will have the same -coordinates as and , but the -coordinates will be and , respectively. Therefore, the mirrored points are and . We plot these additional points.   The points and are added to the previous graph.    Finally, we connect all the points with a parabola to get the final graph.   The graph of with vertex and axis of symmetry .        How to Graph a Quadratic Function,   Graph the function .     The graph of with vertex and axis of symmetry .      First, identify the coefficients and . Using the formula for , we get:     Next, compute :     The vertex is and the axis of symmetry is the vertical line . Begin the graph by plotting the vertex and axis of symmetry.   The vertex and axis are plotted.    Now compute two additional points one and two units to the right of the vertex:        Plot these two points.   The points and are added.    Reflect across the axis to obtain the mirrored points:     Plot these mirrored points as well.   The reflected points and are added.    Finally, connect the points with a smooth downward-opening parabola to obtain the final graph.   The graph of with vertex and axis of symmetry .        Graphing Quadratic Functions Using Intercepts  While the previous method always works, it requires you to remember some unusual formulas. When the parabola crosses the -axis, you can instead use the vertex, the -intercept, and the -intercepts to plot key points. The next example shows how to do this.   How to Graph a Quadratic Function Using Intercepts   Graph the function     The graph of , the vertex , and the intercepts , , and .      Since and , we use the formulas for and to find the vertex.        Therefore, the vertex is . To find the -intercepts, we use the quadratic formula:        Therefore, the -intercepts are and . To find the -intercept, we evaluate :   Therefore, the -intercept is . We then plot all four points and sketch the parabola through them to obtain the graph.

  "body": " Zeros and Multiplicity   The Complete Linear Factorization of  The ultimate goal of this chapter is to find the complete linear factorization of a polynomial function .    The complete linear factorization of a degree polynomial function with leading coefficient is given by the formula where , , , , are the (not necessarily distinct) solutions to the equation .    Let's think about what this statement says.    There is a relationship between factoring and solutions to polynomial equations.  A degree polynomial function has solutions.  Since the can be the same value, a solution can be “repeated.”  Since this statement is a theorem, there is a proof that this complete linear factorization can always be found.    While the proof is beyond the scope of this course, our main focus is on the first implication: there is a relationship between factoring and solving equations. We already this relationship in Chapter 4: the Zero Product Theorem. We also said in Chapter 4 that the Zero Product Theorem works no matter how many factors there are. That means if then finding the solution to the equation is equivalent to solving the equations   This is very abstract. So, let's look at a concrete example of this idea in action.   Using the Complete Linear Factorization to Solve an Equation   The complete linear factorization of the polynomial function is Use the complete linear factorization of the function to solve the equation .              We will replace the original definition of with its complete linear factorization and then use the Zero Product Property to solve the equation.         It is mysterious, though, how we went from to None of our factoring techniques show us how to factor this polynomial. Starting in , we will develop techniques that will allow us to factor these types of polynomials. But, for the moment, we will explore the relationship between the solutions of and the -intercepts of the graph of .    The Zeroes of a Polynomial Function   A complex number is a zero of a polynomial function if .    Zeros are also called the roots or solutions of the polynomial equation .   Wait — a complex number ? You might ask yourself if that is a typo, but that is correct. Some of the in our complete linear factorization will be complex! Let's look at two examples and see how this plays out.   Finding the zeroes of a polynomial function with distinct, real zeroes   Find the zeroes of the polynomial             “Find the zeroes of ” is another way to say “solve the equation ” Therefore, we get the following calculation.       Now, you might note that is not of the form , which is required for the complete linear factorization. There is a theorem that helps us with that.   Rewriting Linear Factors that Have Rational Solutions   Any linear factor of the form can always be rewritten as .    In other words, we could have rewritten as , but that requires an extra step that is really not necessary when we are solving for .  Now, let's solve an equation with complex solutions.   Finding the zeroes of a polynomial function with one real solution and two complex solutions   Find the zeroes of the function             Since this is a sum of cubes formula, we will first apply that formula.     Notice that the factor is irreducible since its discriminant is negative. But if we allow complex solutions, we can use the quadratic formula to find the complex solutions without having to factor over the complex numbers. The calculation for the quadratic formula is given below.     Now, we can finish solving the equation.        We did not write out the complete linear factorization when solving since this tends to confuse students at first. For the record, the complete linear factorization is Also, notice that we have see products like before in .     The Multiplicity of a Zero  When we stated , we mentioned that the solutions to the polynomial equation can be repeated. This leads to the idea of multiplicity, which has two major uses in this chapter:   Visualizing how the graph of a polynomial crosses or bounces off the -axis.    As a trick to simplify solving polynomial inequalities.   We first start by defining multiplicity.   The Multiplicity of a Zero   Let be any polynomial function that has a factor of , where .   The exponent is called the multiplicity of the zero .    If , then is called a repeated zero of .       Let's illustrate this definition with an example.   Finding the Multiplicities of a Factored Polynomial   Let . Find the zeroes and their multiplicities.      has multiplicity  has multiplicity  has multiplicity      To find the zeroes, we will set and use the Zero Product Property.     To find the multiplicity of the zeroes, we just have to look back at which factor generated each solution.    Since came from the factor and , the multiplicity of is .  Since came from the factor , the multiplicity of is .  Since came from the factor and , the multiplicity of is .  Note that both and are repeated zeroes since their multiplicities are greater than 1.      Visualizing Zeroes as -intercepts  The real zeroes of a polynomial correspond to the -intercepts of the graph. On top of that, the multiplicity of the zero also dictates the shape of the graph near the -intercept. The key feature is not the exact value of the multiplicity—it is whether the multiplicity is , an odd number greater than , or an even number.   The Shape of the Graph Near an -intercept   Suppose is a zero of a polynomial that has multiplicity . The following figures illustrate the different ways a polynomial can behave near the -intercept .   The graph will cross as a straight-ish line if .    The graph can either cross from upper left to lower right.     Or the graph can cross from lower left to upper right.       The graph will cross at similar to how crosses at if and is odd.    The graph can either cross from upper left to lower right while flattening at .     Or the graph can cross from lower left to upper right while flattening at .       The graph will bounce off the -axis at if is even.    Bounce off the -axis at from above.     Bounce off the -axis at from below.         Determine if the Graph Will Cross or Bounce at an -intercept   Let . Find the zeroes, their multiplicities, and classify whether the graph will cross or bounce at the zeroes.

Why do we call the local extrema of the function turning points? Think of the graph as a road twisting through the countryside. At certain points, we have to turn to the left or right and make a sharp turn. The graph of the function does this as well: instead of turning left and right, we are turning sharply from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. The turning point is just the sharpest point in the turn.  Unlike quadratic functions, the local extrema of a function are typically hard to find using algebra alone. This implies that the turning points of a polynomial function are hard to find. In fact, most turning points require calculus in order to find their exact coordinates. But, even if we can't calculate the points exactly, there are still somethings we can still say about turning points, as the following theorem shows.

The Division Algorithm gives us a way to define division in terms of multiplication and addition for any two numbers and . We find the values and using long division . Our next two examples show us what happens.   Long Division with a Non-Zero Remainder   Use long division to divide by . Then express the result using the Division Algorithm.       First, we set up the long division as follows:   The 35 goes under the long division symbol and the 5 is written to the left of the symbol.    Then, we ask ourselves, how many times does divide into ? It divides 7 times, and we write the above the one's digit of 37 and above the long division symbol as follows:   The 7 is written above the 7 in 37 and above the long division symbol.    We then multiply by to get and write that below the .   The 35 is written below 37.    Then we subtract from to get .   We put a line under 35 and write 2 below the line.    Since , the Division Algorithm says we can stop dividing. The number above the long division symbol is the quotient , and the we get after the subtraction is the remainder . Therefore, the Division Algorithm says that     Long Division with a Zero Remainder   Use long division to divide by . Then express the result using the Division Algorithm.       First, we set up the long division as follows:   The 136 goes under the long division symbol and the 4 is written to the left of the symbol.    We ask ourselves, how many times does divide into the first digit, ? It does not divide evenly, so we consider the first two digits, . The number divides into three times, since .   The 3 is written above the 3 in 136 and above the long division symbol.    We multiply and write below .   We write 12 under the hundreds and tens digits, which look like \"13\".    Then, we subtract to get .   We put a line under 12 and write 1 below the line.    We then bring down the next digit, , to make .   We bring down the 6 and place it next to the 1.    The number divides into exactly times, and we write the above the one's digit in .   The next quotient digit 4 is written above the 6.    Since , we write below the existing .   We write 16 below the existing 16 in preparation for another subtraction.    We subtract from to get .   We write a line below the second , and write below the line.    Since , the division ends here. The number above the long division symbol is the quotient , and the remainder is . Therefore, the Division Algorithm says that .    Notice that, in our last example, simplifies to . We just proved that factors as and . Sound familiar? This is what we want to do with polynomials. Fortunately, a Division Algorithm for polynomials exists as well!    Polynomial Version  Before we state the Division Algorithm for Polynomials, we need to define what is the “zero” for polynomials.   The Zero Polynomial  The zero polynomial is the polynomial whose value is zero for every value of . We write the zero polynomial as for all real numbers .    Don’t confuse the zero polynomial with solving a polynomial equation . While the notations are identical, the contexts are very different. Thankfully, these concepts don’t typically come into direct contact with one another, so the context of the problem will tell you which version of the notation we are using.    The Division Algorithm   Let and be polynomials, where is not the zero polynomial. Then there exist unique polynomials, a quotient  and a remainder  , such that   where the degree of is less than the degree of .    is called the dividend .     is called the divisor .        Polynomial Long Division Example   Use polynomial long division to divide by . Then express the result using the Division Algorithm for polynomials.       First, we set up the division as follows.   We set up the long division by putting under the long division symbol and to the left of the division symbol    We begin by writing a fraction: the numerator is the leading term of and the denominator is the leading term of . We then simplify this fraction, and this is the number of times the leading term of the divisor divides the leading term of the dividend. In this case, we get the following: Since is a degree 1 term, we will write it above the degree 1 term of the dividend.   The leading term is written above the long division symbol.    Next, we multiply the divisor by to get . We write this result below the dividend, make sure the terms with the same powers are vertically lined up. We then write a line under this expression.   We write below the and the terms.    Next, we subtract from the dividend     and write that result below the horizontal line we drew.   After subtraction, the new expression is .    Again, we write a fraction: the numerator is the leading term of and the denominator is the leading term of . We then simplify this fraction to get the next division: We write the above the constant term of the dividend   is written above the constant term in .    and multiply by the divisor to get . We write this product below and write a line below it.   The product written below .    Now we subtract the two expressions     and write the 3 below the horizontal line we drew.   After the final subtraction, the remainder is .    Since the remainder has degree 0 and the divisor has degree 1, the Division Algorithm tells us we can stop here. The quotient is and the remainder is . Therefore,      Polynomial Long Division Example   Use polynomial long division to divide by . Then express the result using the Division Algorithm for polynomials.       First, we set up the division as follows.   We set up the long division by putting under the long division symbol and to the left of the division symbol.    We begin by writing a fraction: the numerator is the leading term of and the denominator is the leading term of . We then simplify this fraction; the result tells us how many times the leading term of the divisor divides the leading term of the dividend. In this case,  Since is degree 2, we write it above the degree 2 term of the dividend.   The leading quotient term is written above the long division symbol.    Next, we multiply the divisor by to get . We write this result below the dividend, aligning like powers, and draw a horizontal line.   We write below the matching power terms.    Now subtract:      After the first subtraction, the new expression is .    Again, form the fraction of leading terms and simplify to get the next quotient term:  We write in the quotient.   The next quotient term is written above the degree 1 place.    Multiply by the divisor to get . Write this below and draw a line.   The product is written below .    Subtract again:      After the second subtraction, the new expression is .    Form the leading-term fraction once more:  We write in the quotient.   The final quotient term is written above the constant place, completing the quotient .    Multiply by the divisor to get , write it below, and subtract:      After the final subtraction, the remainder is .    Since the remainder has degree less than the divisor , the Division Algorithm tells us we can stop here. The quotient is and the remainder is . Therefore,     Just like with integers, notice that when the remainder is zero, we get a factorization of the polynomials. Our next goal is to find a consistent way to divide polynomials to get remainders of zero. But first, we will introduce a simpler way to divide polynomials of certain forms in the next section.   "

For example, it is possible to get more than one quadratic factor we will have to solve. But overall, this pattern serves most students well when they factor higher degree polynomials.

Any degree polynomial can be factored.      The complete linear factorization of a degree polynomial function with leading coefficient is given by the formula where , , , , are the (not necessarily distinct) solutions to the equation .     Using the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to Construct a Polynomial   Let be a real-valued polynomial that has leading coefficient , degree and roots and . Determine what polynomial should equal. You may leave the polynomial in its factored form.         Since had degree , we know there are three zeroes. But, the problem only gives us two solutions. But, since one of the zeroes is complex and complex zeroes come in conjugate pairs, we know that is another zero of the polynomial. By the Complete Linear Factorization Theorem, But, we don't want any complex numbers in our polynomial since it is real-valued; so, we need to multiply . Thankfully, this is a sum of squares and easily multiplies: Therefore, the polynomial we are looking for is While the instructions say you can leave it factored, if you multiplied the polynomial out, we get      Using the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to Construct a Polynomial   Let be a real-valued polynomial that has leading coefficient , degree and roots and .

Therefore, the polynomial we are looking for is While the instructions say you can leave it factored, if you multiplied the polynomial out, we get      Using the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to Construct a Polynomial   Let be a real-valued polynomial that has degree and roots and . Determine what polynomial should equal if . You may leave the polynomial in its factored form.         Since we know all the zeroes, the Complete Linear Factorization Theorem tells us that, But, we don't want any complex numbers in our polynomial since it is real-valued; so, we need to multiply . Thankfully, this is a sum of squares and easily multiplies: Therefore, the polynomial we are looking for is To find the value of , we solve the equation for : Therefore, the polynomial we are looking for is If we fully multiply it out, we get       A real-valued polynomial is irreducible if it can be only be factored using complex numbers.      Any degree polynomial is reducible over the real numbers.    This is easy to see with odd degree polynomials. Since complex zeroes come in pairs and there are an odd number of zeroes in an odd degree polynomial, it always has at least 1 real zero. We'll do an example to show the plausibility for even degree polynomials.   Factoring an Even Degree Polynomial That Does Not Have Any Rational Roots   Factor the polynomial . Express your final answer as a product of irreducible factors.         Notice that the given polynomial is quadratic in form. Let . Then, we get the following calculation.      Factoring an Even Degree Polynomial That Does Not Have Any Rational Roots   Factor the polynomial . Express your final answer as a product of irreducible factors.         This problem requires a couple of tricks. While none of these tricks are beyond your skill set, you are not likely to see them unless they are pointed out. The first trick is factor out an and group the terms in a particular way. Now, the factor in the square brackets is almost quadratic in form. Unfortunately, . But they are barely not equal to each other. To see this, let's pretend the factor in the square brackets is quadratic in form. Let . Then Since we have a substitution for both and in terms of , we can continue to factor:     Linear factors are always irreducible; but quadratic factors may or may not be reducible. The following theorem tells us when we can reduce a quadratic factor into linear factors with real zeroes.    Let be any quadratic function. If the discriminant is negative, then is irreducible over the real numbers.    By the Complete Linear Factorization Theorem, The solutions to the equation given by the Quadratic Formula are the values of and by the Factor Theorem. We know that the Quadratic Formula only gives complex solutions when the discriminant is negative. Therefore, a quadratic polynomial is irreducible when the discriminant is negative.    This leads us to the our final statement in this section.    Let be any real-valued polynomial. Then it can always be factored using linear and irreducible quadratic factors.

When we perform the cancellation, we can write the condition that next to the simplified version of the function to remind ourselves that is not in the domain. The following calculation shows us how to do this: This leads us to an important idea for graphing rational functions: the graph of a rational function is the same as its simplified version but with holes or asymptotes whenever we cancel off linear factors.

How to Find a Vertical Asymptote of a Rational Function   Let be any rational function. To find the vertical asymptotes of the graph, follow this procedure.   Completely factor the numerator and denominator into their linear and irreducible quadratic factors.    Find all the linear factors of the denominator. By the Factor Theorem, each linear factor corresponds to a zero of the denominator and will make undefined.    For each linear factor of the denominator, determine if it also appears in the numerator.   If it doesn't, then is a vertical asymptote of .    If the linear factor also appears in the numerator, then we have a vertical asymptote at only if the multiplicity of the denominator is larger that the multiplicity of the numerator.           Finding the Vertical Asymptotes of a Rational Function   Find all the vertical asymptotes for the rational function .    The following vertical lines are vertical asymptotes.                The first step is to completely factor the numerator and denominator. Since the numerator is just a constant, we only have to factor the denominator.  To factor the denominator, first note that the coefficients of sum to 1; therefore, the Test for tells us that is a zero the denominator. We can use synthetic division to factor the polynomial.   Synthetic division shows that the quotient is    Notice that the quotient is a perfect square trinomial and can be factored as . Therefore, , and our fully factored rational function is By the Factor Theorem, the linear factors of the denominator correspond to values of that make the denominator equal to zero. Since neither linear factor appears in the numerator, we can conclude that the vertical lines and are vertical asymptotes of the graph.   The graph of with vertical asymptotes and drawn as red, vertical, dashed lines.       Finding the Vertical Asymptotes of a Rational Function   Find all the vertical asymptotes for the rational function .    The following vertical lines are vertical asymptotes.           In the last example, we saw that . Notice that the denominator is a perfect square trinomial; therefore, it factors as . Therefore, our completely factored polynomial is Since the multiplicity of is 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator, the denominator has the larger multiplicity. Therefore, the vertical line is an asymptote.   The graph of with a vertical asymptote at drawn as a red, vertical, dashed line.       Finding the Vertical Asymptotes of a Rational Function   Find all the vertical asymptotes for the rational function .    The following vertical lines are vertical asymptotes.           This rational function is already factored for us. Notice that the factor appears in both the numerator and denominator. Unlike the previous example, the multiplicities of are the same in the numerator and denominator. Since the denominator does not have a larger multiplicity, there is not a vertical asymptote at . In fact, since there are no other linear factors in the denominator to generate an asymptote, this rational function does not have any vertical asymptote.   The graph of has a hole at instead of a vertical asymptote at .        Multiplicities of the Denominator  While the multiplicity of a linear factor in the numerator tells us how we cross or bounce off the x-axis, the multiplicity of a linear factor in the denominator tells us how the graph behaves near a vertical asymptote. In fact, if we think of infinity as a point that we cannot see on the coordinate plane, then the multiplicity of a linear factor in the denominator tells us how the graph crosses or bounces off of infinity.  If the multiplicity is odd, the graph will cross at infinity, as we see in the figures below.   The graphs of two rational functions with a vertical asymptote . The multiplicity of is odd.    The graph of crosses from to at .     The graph of crosses from to at .      If the multiplicity is even, the graph will bounce off the vertical asymptote, as we see in the figures below.

Simplifying and Finding Multiplicities For the Denominator  When finding the multiplicities for the zeroes of the denominator, be sure to use the fully simplified version of the rational function. Any common factors that were canceled off will affect the multiplicities of the zeroes of the denominator.    Finding the Zeroes of the Denominator and Their Multiplicities   Find the zeroes of the denominator of the rational function and state their multiplicities.        with multiplicity 1     with multiplicity 2       The denominator is already factored for us. By the Factor Theorem, the linear factors of the denominator correspond to values of that make the denominator equal to zero.  Since the linear factors are and , the zeroes of the denominator are and .  Since the factor has multiplicity 1 and the factor has multiplicity 2, then the zero has multiplicity 1 and the zero has multiplicity 2.     "

Synthetic division shows that the quotient is    Notice that the quotient is a perfect square trinomial and can be factored as . Therefore, , and our fully factored rational function is By the Factor Theorem, the linear factors of the denominator correspond to values of that make the denominator equal to zero. Since neither linear factor appears in the numerator, we can conclude that the vertical lines and are vertical asymptotes of the graph.

Find the -intercept (if it exists) and express it as a point .    Factor the numerator and denominator, but do not cancel any factors yet.    Find the zeroes of the denominator (if they exist) and determine the type of behavior (vertical asymptote or hole) for each zero.    Cancel off the common factors.    Determine the end behavior of the function.    Determine if the graph crosses the horizontal, oblique, or nonlinear. Plot any points of intersection.    Find the zeroes of the numerator (if they exist) and their multiplicities.  Express your -intercepts as and graph them as solid dots unless they correspond to a hole, in which case use an open dot.  Use the multiplicities to determine whether the graph crosses or bounces at each intercept.      Determine the multiplicities of the remaining zeroes of the denominator. The multiplicities of the denominator determine the graph's behavior near the vertical asymptotes.  Even multiplicities mean that the graph “bounces off infinity.”  Odd multiplicities mean that the graph “crosses from positive to negative infinity,” or vice versa.      Use the intercepts, end behavior, and multiplicities to draw a general sketch of the graph. Plot additional points as needed to further define the shape of the graph.       Graphing a Rational Function   Graph the function .     The graph of      We follow the steps from the above procedure to graph the function. First, we find the -intercept by evaluating . Thus, the -intercept is the point .   The graph of the -intercept    Next, we observe that both the numerator and denominator are already factored. By the Factor Theorem, we know that the zeroes are , , and . Therefore, the domain in interval notation is .  Now, we cancel off the common factor of from the numerator and denominator. Therefore, we know we have a hole at , and there are two vertical asymptotes: the vertical lines and . To find the value of the hole, we evaluate the simplified version of at . This calculation implies that the hole is at the point .   The graph of the hole and the vertical asymptotes and are added to the graph.    Next, we determine the end behavior of the function. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is (aka the -axis). To find if the graph crosses the horizontal asymptote, set and solve for . Since this equation has no solution, the graph does not cross the horizontal asymptote. This calculation also implies that there are no -intercepts.   The end behavior of the function is added to the graph.    Next, we determine the multiplicities of zeroes of the denominator. The factor has multiplicity 1. This implies that the graph crosses at infinity at .  The factor has multiplicity 2, which implies that the graph bounces off infinity at .   The behavior near the vertical asymptotes are added to the graph.    We now have enough information to sketch in the rest of the graph.   The graph of      "

  "body": " Procedure  Let be any rational function. Use the following steps to graph the function.   Find the -intercept (if it exists) and express it as a point .    Factor the numerator and denominator, but do not cancel any factors yet.    Find the zeroes of the denominator (if they exist) and determine the type of behavior (vertical asymptote or hole) for each zero.    Cancel off the common factors.    Determine the end behavior of the function.    Determine if the graph crosses the horizontal, oblique, or nonlinear. Plot any points of intersection.    Find the zeroes of the numerator (if they exist) and their multiplicities.  Express your -intercepts as and graph them as solid dots unless they correspond to a hole, in which case use an open dot.  Use the multiplicities to determine whether the graph crosses or bounces at each intercept.      Determine the multiplicities of the remaining zeroes of the denominator. The multiplicities of the denominator determine the graph's behavior near the vertical asymptotes.  Even multiplicities mean that the graph “bounces off infinity.”  Odd multiplicities mean that the graph “crosses from positive to negative infinity,” or vice versa.      Use the intercepts, end behavior, and multiplicities to draw a general sketch of the graph. Plot additional points as needed to further define the shape of the graph.     "

By the Factor Theorem, we know that the zeroes are , , and . Therefore, the domain in interval notation is .  Now, we cancel off the common factor of from the numerator and denominator. Therefore, we know we have a hole at , and there are two vertical asymptotes: the vertical lines and . To find the value of the hole, we evaluate the simplified version of at . This calculation implies that the hole is at the point .   The graph of the hole and the vertical asymptotes and are added to the graph.    Next, we determine the end behavior of the function. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is (aka the -axis). To find if the graph crosses the horizontal asymptote, set and solve for . Since this equation has no solution, the graph does not cross the horizontal asymptote. This calculation also implies that there are no -intercepts.   The end behavior of the function is added to the graph.    Next, we determine the multiplicities of zeroes of the denominator. The factor has multiplicity 1. This implies that the graph crosses at infinity at .  The factor has multiplicity 2, which implies that the graph bounces off infinity at .   The behavior near the vertical asymptotes are added to the graph.    We now have enough information to sketch in the rest of the graph.   The graph of     "

Notice that our graph is a reciprocal function with a vertical asymptote at and a horizontal asymptote at . To make this function one-to-one, we can restrict the domain to or . Let's choose for our restriction. Now, let's find the inverse of the restricted function. The question becomes: do we choose the positive or negative root?

The standard form of a polynomial function is any function of the form . There are four important definitions related to polynomial functions that we will use in Chapters 5 and 6.  The highest power of is called the degree of the polynomial function. The degree of a generic function is denoted as .  The term containing the highest power of is called the leading term . The leading term of a generic polynomial function is denoted as .  is called the leading coefficient .  The term without any variables is called the constant term . The constant term of a generic polynomial is denoted as .       Identifying Polynomial Functions   Which of the following functions are polynomial?             Identifying the Key Parts of a Polynomial, Version 2   Let . Find the degree, leading term, leading coefficient, and constant term.   Although polynomial terms are usually written from highest to lowest degree, this order is a matter of convention, not a mathematical requirement. Only certain techniques, such as polynomial long division or synthetic division, rely on that order. Therefore, do not assume the leading or constant terms will always appear first and last.    Identifying the Key Parts of a Polynomial, Version 3   Let . Find the degree, leading term, leading coefficient, and constant term.   Every real number can be written as since . Therefore, horizontal lines such as are also degree 0 polynomials, since the highest power of is 0.    Identifying the Key Parts of a Factored Polynomial   Let . Find the degree, leading term, and constant term.   While this seems harder, the solution is very straightforward.  First, we find the leading term by ignoring the and in the factors to get the product Now that we have the leading term, we see that the degree is and the leading coefficient is .  To find the constant term, we just ignore the in each factor and multiply to get    The Leading Coefficient Test   Let be any polynomial function with leading term . The following figures describe the four different types of end behavior a polynomial function may have.   For odd degree polynomials, the graph will have opposite end behaviors.     If and is odd, then  will approach as approaches ,  will approach as approaches , and  we draw an arrow rising up to the right and an arrow falling down to the left.

The complete linear factorization of a degree polynomial function with leading coefficient is given by the formula where , , , , are the (not necessarily distinct) solutions to the equation .    Let's think about what this statement says.    There is a relationship between factoring and solutions to polynomial equations.  A degree polynomial function has solutions.  Since the can be the same value, a solution can be “repeated.”  Since this statement is a theorem, there is a proof that this complete linear factorization can always be found.     Using the Complete Linear Factorization to Solve an Equation   The complete linear factorization of the polynomial function is Use the complete linear factorization of the function to solve the equation .     A complex number is a zero of a polynomial function if .    Zeros are also called the roots or solutions of the polynomial equation .    Finding the zeroes of a polynomial function with one real solution and two complex solutions   Find the zeroes of the function     The Multiplicity of a Zero   Let be any polynomial function that has a factor of , where .   The exponent is called the multiplicity of the zero .    If , then is called a repeated zero of .        Finding the Multiplicities of a Factored Polynomial   Let . Find the zeroes and their multiplicities.     The Shape of the Graph Near an -intercept   Suppose is a zero of a polynomial that has multiplicity . The following figures illustrate the different ways a polynomial can behave near the -intercept .   The graph will cross as a straight-ish line if .    The graph can either cross from upper left to lower right.     Or the graph can cross from lower left to upper right.       The graph will cross at similar to how crosses at if and is odd.    The graph can either cross from upper left to lower right while flattening at .     Or the graph can cross from lower left to upper right while flattening at .

Determine if the Graph Will Cross or Bounce at an -intercept   Let . Find the zeroes, their multiplicities, and classify whether the graph will cross or bounce at the zeroes.      Graphing and Factor Theorem Notes   Graphing Polynomial Functions   Let be any polynomial function. Use the following steps to sketch a graph by hand.  Determine the end behavior.  Find the -intercept.  Determine the zeroes (if they exist) and their multiplicities.  Plot additional points as necessary.  Make sure there are no more than turning points (local extrema).       Graphing a Degree 3 Polynomial   Graph the function .    Consider the following graph of .   The graph of .    While it is clear from the graph that we have two -intercepts: and , try to solve using any of the techniques we have learned so far. You will see that they all fail. Furthermore, the polynomial factors nicely as . Again, no factoring technique we have learned will factor this polynomial.   The Division Algorithm for Natural Numbers   Let and be natural numbers (nonzero, positive, whole numbers). Then there exist two unique numbers, a quotient  and a remainder  , such that , where .  is known as the dividend .  is known as the divisor .      The Division Algorithm gives us a way to define division in terms of multiplication and addition for any two numbers and . We find the values and using long division . Our next two examples show us what happens.   Long Division with a Zero Remainder   Use long division to divide by . Then express the result using the Division Algorithm.     The Zero Polynomial   The zero polynomial is the polynomial whose value is zero for every value of . We write the zero polynomial as for all real numbers .     Don’t confuse the zero polynomial with solving a polynomial equation . While the notations are identical, the contexts are very different. Thankfully, these concepts don’t typically come into direct contact with one another, so the context of the problem will tell you which version of the notation we are using.    The Division Algorithm   Let and be polynomials, where is not the zero polynomial. Then there exist unique polynomials, a quotient  and a remainder  , such that   where the degree of is less than the degree of .  is called the dividend .  is called the divisor .       Polynomial Long Division Example   Use polynomial long division to divide by . Then express the result using the Division Algorithm for polynomials.     Polynomial Long Division Example   Use polynomial long division to divide by . Then express the result using the Division Algorithm for polynomials.    Recall that we are looking for a way to factor any polynomial function as . Since we have seen that there is a relationship between factoring and dividing, notice that all our factors look like minus a number. So, let’s look at how dividing by and the Division Algorithm work together.  But polynomial long division, as we have seen, can be long, tedious, and cumbersome to write. It turns out that when we divide by , there is a shorthand version of polynomial long division called synthetic division that can make this process faster and less error-prone. Instead of writing a step-by-step method, we will just illustrate how this works in the next three examples.   Synthetic Division, First Example   Use Synthetic Division to divide by . Write your final answer using the Division Algorithm.     Synthetic Division, Second Example   Use Synthetic Division to divide by . Write your final answer using the Division Algorithm.     Synthetic Division, Third Example   Use Synthetic Division to divide by . Write your final answer using the Division Algorithm.     The Remainder Theorem   Let be any polynomial function and let for some real number . Then the remainder is equal to .     Evaluating a Polynomial Using the Remainder Theorem   Let . Evaluate .     The Factor Theorem   Let be any polynomial function. The following two statements are equivalent to each other.  is a zero of .  is a factor of .      Since we just proved that factoring is another way to find solutions to polynomial equations,  We don't have to set polynomials equal to zero to solve them; we just need to factor them. This alleviates the confusion between solving an equation and simplifying an expression.  If we know a zero of the polynomial, we can use Synthetic or Polynomial Long Division to find the other factor that doesn't correspond to the zero. This helps us factor higher-degree polynomials.     Factoring a Degree 4 Polynomial   Suppose you know that and are zeroes of the polynomial . Find the other zeroes of the polynomial.    The overall technique we will use is  Find any zero of .  Use synthetic division to factor the polynomial.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you end with a quadratic factor.  Use the methods from Chapter 4 to find the remaining two solutions (if they exist).

Express your final answer as a product of irreducible factors.      Let be any quadratic function. If the discriminant is negative, then is irreducible over the real numbers.    By the Complete Linear Factorization Theorem, The solutions to the equation given by the Quadratic Formula are the values of and by the Factor Theorem. We know that the Quadratic Formula only gives complex solutions when the discriminant is negative. Therefore, a quadratic polynomial is irreducible when the discriminant is negative.      Let be any real-valued polynomial. Then it can always be factored using linear and irreducible quadratic factors.     Illustrative example of   Factor .          "

How to Find a Vertical Asymptote of a Rational Function   Let be any rational function. To find the vertical asymptotes of the graph, follow this procedure.  Completely factor the numerator and denominator into their linear and irreducible quadratic factors.  Find all the linear factors of the denominator. By the Factor Theorem, each linear factor corresponds to a zero of the denominator and will make undefined.   For each linear factor of the denominator, determine if it also appears in the numerator.  If it doesn't, then is a vertical asymptote of .  If the linear factor also appears in the numerator, then we have a vertical asymptote at only if the multiplicity of the denominator is larger than the multiplicity of the numerator.

Finding the Vertical Asymptotes of a Rational Function   Find all the vertical asymptotes for the rational function .    While the multiplicity of a linear factor in the numerator tells us how we cross or bounce off the x-axis, the multiplicity of a linear factor in the denominator tells us how the graph behaves near a vertical asymptote. In fact, if we think of infinity as a point that we cannot see on the coordinate plane, then the multiplicity of a linear factor in the denominator tells us how the graph crosses or bounces off of infinity.  If the multiplicity is odd, the graph will cross at infinity, as we see in the figures below.   The graphs of two rational functions with a vertical asymptote . The multiplicity of is odd.

Simplifying and Finding Multiplicities For the Denominator  When finding the multiplicities for the zeroes of the denominator, be sure to use the fully simplified version of the rational function.

Theorem   Let be any rational function whose numerator and denominator have a common factor of , where the integer and the integer .

Find the zeroes of the denominator (if they exist) and determine the type of behavior (vertical asymptote or hole) for each zero.    Cancel off the common factors.    Determine the end behavior of the function.    Determine if the graph crosses the horizontal, oblique, or nonlinear asymptote. Plot any points of intersection.    Find the zeroes of the numerator (if they exist) and their multiplicities.  Express your -intercepts as and graph them as solid dots unless they correspond to a hole, in which case use an open dot.  Use the multiplicities to determine whether the graph crosses or bounces at each intercept.      Determine the multiplicities of the remaining zeroes of the denominator. The multiplicities of the denominator determine the graph's behavior near the vertical asymptotes.  Even multiplicities mean that the graph “bounces off infinity.”  Odd multiplicities mean that the graph “crosses from positive to negative infinity,” or vice versa.      Use the intercepts, end behavior, and multiplicities to draw a general sketch of the graph. Plot additional points as needed to further define the shape of the graph.

Find the zeroes of the denominator (if they exist) and determine the type of behavior (vertical asymptote or hole) for each zero.    Cancel off the common factors.    Determine the end behavior of the function.    Determine if the graph crosses the horizontal, oblique, or nonlinear asymptote. Plot any points of intersection.    Find the zeroes of the numerator (if they exist) and their multiplicities.  Express your -intercepts as and graph them as solid dots unless they correspond to a hole, in which case use an open dot.  Use the multiplicities to determine whether the graph crosses or bounces at each intercept.      Determine the multiplicities of the remaining zeroes of the denominator. The multiplicities of the denominator determine the graph's behavior near the vertical asymptotes.  Even multiplicities mean that the graph “bounces off infinity.”  Odd multiplicities mean that the graph “crosses from positive to negative infinity,” or vice versa.      Use the intercepts, end behavior, and multiplicities to draw a general sketch of the graph. Plot additional points as needed to further define the shape of the graph.     "
